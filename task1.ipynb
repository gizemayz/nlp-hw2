            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a commitment to the PTA's motion to investigate the motories' problems. I salute the General Assembly. <p> Dear lawmakers, the actions of thousands of Messepeti workers moto couriers are today on their 17th day. Our motorcade brothers, who were hosted under the roof of our House the other day, are being heavily exploited under heavy conditions. In pandemic conditions, they worked their lives off, and the companies they worked for made them worth a lot more than they were worth. But the motoriers are forced to work for the price of misery. In one night, thousands of motorists were stripped of their rights to join the union by changing their line of work. About 900,000 motories are fighting for their lives in our country. They're fighting for their lives because they're under heavy exploitation costs; they're fighting for their lives because they're being sent to die in traffic under early delivery pressure. In 2020, 280 motories died in car accidents, and there's almost no motokure anywhere in their bodies without any signs of an accident. <p> The government has left hundreds of thousands of motorists among the giant wheels of the e-commerce sector. The Ministry of Commerce is silent against the early delivery campaigns of companies that pressured moto couriers to death. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is silent against the unregistered operation of hundreds of thousands of motorists, violating occupational health and safety. The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure is silent against the demands of the killer barriers, which have killed hundreds of motorists, to ensure safe passage through the bridges and tunnels. The Ministry of Finance is silent against requests for removal of motoriers' protection equipment from SVR, VAT and customs duties. The Home Office's eyes are closed to reduce motorists' traffic accidents and problems, even though all images are available with MOBESE cameras. <p> So, what are the demands of the moto-carriers that are being worked at the expense of their lives in these difficult conditions? He wants his most basic, human rights, motoriers. <p> The esteemed MPs, a group of representatives of motoriers and Messepeti employees, met with our chairman, Mr Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in Parliament and explained their problems. Our president said we'd take care of his problems with motorier representatives. By making sure that the problems of the Motocuries are investigated in the House, we can eliminate the first unclaimed motokury area from being the life market for dozens of accidents every day. <p> We support the motion. <p> I salute the General Assembly.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the AK PARTI Group against the <PARTY>'s proposals to open a parliamentary investigation into the alleged violations of rights in prisons. On this occasion, I salute the General Assembly. <p> Tomorrow is Teacher's Day. I wish all our teachers to have a good life, and I celebrate Teachers' Day, and I cherish all our teachers who come to eternity. <p> Mr. President, the esteemed MPs, we are members of a great civilization. In our faith, man is a man, and man is a man of honour. AS AK PARTY, from the first day we were founded, let the human being live so that the state can live. With his understanding until now -- we accepted this understanding as the center of our politics -- we first put man, human honor above everything, we accepted the basis of everything. For us, it's human dignity that's the basis of our politics. It's up to the politician, to the congressman, to protect the honor of the people he represents, to protect his honor and to protect his glory. The Republic of Turkey is a constitutional law state that recognizes the rule of law. According to the Constitution, in the section of Basic Rights and Homework, everyone has basic rights and freedoms that are bound to their personality, untouchable, non-transmittable. <p> Mr. President, the high-value lawmakers have continued their uncompromising practice in this sense, with no tolerance for torture and abuse. AK PARTY has lifted the statute of limitations on torture and abuse. Article 17 of the Constitution shall regulate the ban on torture. According to this, no one can be tortured or tortured; no one can be subjected to punishment or treatment that is incompatible with human dignity. Likewise, the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the Constitution in this sense is constitutionally guaranteed in this respect, and anyone who is violated by the Constitution and its recognised rights and freedoms has the right to ask the authorities for the opportunity to apply without delay. Again, in terms of torture zero tolerances during the AK PARTI period, our punishments and detentions and execution institutions are inspected in five main topics: <p> 1) Executive audit, <p> 2) Judicial audit, <p> 3) Civil society control, <p> 4) Parliamentary audit, <p> 5) International audit. <p> In other words, our detention and detention facilities in Turkey are the Committee for the Protection of the Torture of Europe (CPT), the United Nations Committee for the Protection of Torture (SPT), the Human Rights and Equality Agency of Turkey, the Civil Rights and Equality Agency of Turkey, the independent monitoring boards established by Law 4681, the Turkish Parliament's Human Rights Review Commission, the county and district human rights boards boards, the district and district prosecutors... the allegations of tortures and tortures in our prisons and prisons established by the Ministry of Justice in this way. Limits, restrictions, as stated in the Constitution, can only be arranged by law, and can only be done by law. In this sense, it's impossible to talk about a pleasure in our prisons; we can talk about a law-abiding, controlled practice. <p> Therefore, the judicial arrests, detentions, arrests are on the agenda with the decisions of the independent judiciary. Therefore, as alleged here, there is absolutely no need to talk about severe human rights violations, violations of human dignity, practices. These allegations are abstract, subjective claims, which do not reflect the truth and have no legal basis. <p> Here we say to those who have this motion: If so, there is a tip line set up at the Ministry of Justice, which has been subjected to torture and abuse in this prison. I'd like to share with you that there's a unit of people here who are responsible for the torture and abuse of anyone who's been subjected to these reports. <p> In prisons, allegations of battery, insults, threats, abuse -- in this sense, preventing lawyers from speaking -- are certainly unrealistic. According to the decree issued in Article 29779 of the State of Emergency, dated 23/7/2016, who will visit them on the telephone, as well as their talks were carried out in accordance with the ordinance of the law. <p> Regarding the arrest of MPs and the arrest of their co-chairs, the Parliament has decided to remove the immunity of lawmakers with their files on the judiciary, on one occasion. Therefore, the individuals mentioned in these files have no parliamentary immunity, whose immunity has been removed by Parliament as part of the cases they have been tried. At the moment, in accordance with the principle of equality in front of the law, their trial, arrests, and detention continue in the same way within the framework of crime and punishment. <p> Of course, before they went to prison, those who committed these crimes had to think carefully before putting the people on the street. Those who supported barricades, pits, ditchs with their political rhetoric should have taken into account, of course, the consequences. Eden will find it. So, he's going to make a judgment decision on these MPs, before, after, as part of the case. We're not going to rule on whether they're guilty or not, but as alleged, the claim of obstruction of phone calls or contact with their families is certainly not true. I'm going to share with you the information that they've had a lawyer's opinion for three hundred and eighty-four hours and fifty minutes, 421 times. In the same way, Selahattin Demirtaş is alone in a room of 3 people, 71 times interviewed by his attorneys; I would like to share with you that he has been meeting with his wife and brother for a hundred and seven hours and forty-five minutes, and that he has had a closed conversation. <p> In the same way, I would like to share with you that from the moment Figen Yüksekdağ was arrested, he had 54 meetings with his attorneys, 35 hours and 50 minutes with his wife, after being admitted to the institution. <p> In the same way, I'd like to share with you that phone calls have been made during the time appointed by law enforcement. <p> Therefore, your claims are unrealistic. There's no legal basis. Restrictions are held entirely according to legal legislation. <p> We're in a state of emergency from July 15th. But those who object to the extraordinary state practices in Turkey should look to Belgium, France, first. Although there is an extraordinary state in Turkey, there is nothing unusual about it; everyone is going to work, they are able to do their job, Parliament is working, all the institutions of the state are standing and serving their nation. In Europe you can see panzers, tanks, military vehicles in Belgium and France. Why do those who object to these practices in Turkey, who complain about international platforms at every turn, Europe, the international system, Turkey, have no objection to these antidemocratic practices?\n",

            "Text: Then again, I'd like to say a few words about the allegations made by the National Movement Party. <p> The Change in Health Programme and the accessibility of our citizens to a physician have increased greatly. In 2002, the application to a physician per person was averaged 3 to 8 today. <p> At the rate of death, the mother and the baby were able to avoid -- the infant death rate of the other developed countries in 30 years -- from 30 to 7.8 percent in a thousand. Again, I'd like to say that we've drawn the speeds of mother death from 64 in a thousand to 16 in a thousand. <p> In all hospitals in the Ministry of Health, we've brought in a performance-based additional payment application to improve the performance and efficiency of health workers. We continue to work rapidly today to regulate the injustices that have occurred over time. <p> During the EC PARTY, our construction investments continued rapidly, especially in 2002, as my friend mentioned earlier, in health, we're doing city hospitals to eliminate physical hospital conditions. The first of these, you know, started at Kayseri. <p> This is what we call a bed with a fixed bed, a sick bed, a bath, a toilet, a room over 30 square feet that can be lived like a man. In your time, before 2002, we raised the qualified beds to about 6,000 today. Hopefully, in the coming years, when we finish the city hospitals, we'll have turned close to 100 percent -- all together -- into qualified beds. <p> We've also established a 986-bed mother hotel at 238 health facilities in 72 counties. <p> Again, we've established community health centers. <p> There was a terrible situation in the ICU beds in Turkey. There's no room in the beds. Patients were dying. But for the time being, I'll give you the numbers: in 2002, when we had 839 intensive care beds, we raised them to 11.672. <p> Besides, we've established palliative centers. And in this case, to help patients with chronic illness... <p> Again, we've done home care for patients who can't come, who have no one at home, who need care. <p> Thus, we have made the government's emphasis on being an orphan more concrete. <p> The source of healthy manpower increased from 256,000 in 2002 to 530,000 in 2014. <p> We've also equipped our hospitals in medical technology with the qualities that require advanced manpower and advanced technology. We've managed to get the surgery that can't be done in every province to be performed in a much more comfortable way, spreading it to the Turkish sath. I'll give you an example: we've established robotic surgery in our four medical facilities. We've set up a radiotherapy center in our 42 health facilities. We've built 50 health facilities -- including seven health facilities -- KVC headquarters, seven of our medical facilities, and a pediatric VAC center. We've set up oncology centers, we've brought a premature retinal retinopathy diagnostic center to 18 health facilities, we've put a burn unit in 34 health centers. I remember when I was an assistant, and I remember when I was a surgeon, and there was a great deal of pain in the burn patients, infections, no end-of-death situations. In addition, in the 2002s, we reached about 700 organ transplants in the year, reaching 4,300. <p> Dear friends, valued lawmakers, here is one of the most important features of health development, health revolution, and we've increased the number of oral dental centers. We've activated 137 oral dental centers and six oral dental hospitals. <p> Not only that, Turkey went too far in tourism and health tourism. There are now planes full of foreign patients arriving in Turkey today. There are patients from Europe, there are patients from England, there are people from Africa, there are people from the Middle East, there are people from the Middle East, we made it a health tourism paradise, Turkey. <p> Not only that, we also help them by building hospitals in some countries in Africa. We established 250 beds in Somalia, 200 in Sudan, 70 in Pakistan, and 30 in Palestine. Our only goal is to give our people, our patients, their most important service, health care. <p> Of course, it's Medical Day. As our Prime Minister explained today, I'd like to share with you some new developments in health. With the arrangement we're going to make, we've raised their watch by 50%. Along with our physicians, all other health workers will benefit from these raises. At the same time, 75 percent increase will be given to 112 employees and those in intensive care. <p> You know, in 2010, our physicians still have fixed spinning capitals... We were able to get a second pension when the pension was cut, and this arrangement will continue. We also provide our desired physicians with the opportunity to cut pensions on rotating capital revenues. <p> Again, our physicians who wanted to work used to retire at 65 years old, and our physicians who wanted to are now able to work until they are 70 years old. And we'll be able to prevent the gap in our number of physicians a little bit. We've also made significant changes in the cases against them due to the medical procedures of our physicians -- including public insurance -- 50 per cent of which will be paid by the public and 50 per cent by our fellow doctors themselves. In addition, we have allowed our fellow physicians at the private hospital to take advantage of this right as well. <p> Dear friends, we've also extended their insurance policy during an operation when there's a problem with patients. With the new arrangement -- financial liability insurance -- we're bringing up between 400 and 600,000 per case, and we're increasing that by an average of 400,000 liras. We also continue to work on the health workers' share of wear and tear, their demands for an actual service increase. <p> Also, my dear friend, here, spoke of violence in health again. In health, we carry out an important task by implementing the white code. Prior to that, new regulations have come to the doctor about violence and the arrests of those who did violence to the medic, including crimes which were not considered a direct crime. Again, the White Code coordinators have been established in the county. In the same way, there has been an assessment, a punishment, in accordance with article (3) of the Penal Court's 100th Article (3) on the charges of deliberate injury committed during the course of duty against employees serving in health institutions and institutions. 709 people from the police department are trying to help us with our medical facilities -- the deployment of personnel. <p> Dear friends, in all this beauty, I shout once again that we have revolutionized health, and I express it. <p> I wish all of our people a healthy day, to express our opposition to the proposal, to all of you. <p> Thank you.\n",

It's not for safety, it's a misinformation. By court order, 60 per cent of what he's about to receive is blocked by the demand for compensation, and the court blocks it. Therefore, there is no way that this blocked amount can be paid to anyone else in any way, and there is no way that they can be paid for any other purchases. Hence, a TMSF such as this said one of its reasons - was to be paid for it. <p> There are serious alternative investments in employment, especially organised industry, and because of other firms' work, T.K. will increase employment there quickly. So I wanted to correct that misunderstanding. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Sorry, it's against you, it's against you. <p> Mr. President, right now, the commissions of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the General Assembly must be governed according to this Constitutional Court and the Civil Code. If, based on your majority in Parliament, you attempt to run this Turkish Parliament of the Great Nation, in fact, that would be a violation of the Constitution based on the majority. Although the President of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey is here to discuss certain laws that clearly violate the Constitution, as well as some demands from the opposition, as well as the special competent courts, the status and nature of the crime, the current evidence situation, the defendant's suspicion of escape, are completely clichéd, afflicted words, the rights of the parliamentary MPs are taken back here by abstract, one-type statements. <p> Now, look, I have a question motion, too. So as our opposition lawmakers, we have two ways to oversee the government: one question motion and one research motion. I'm here to ask the Minister of Justice to answer, and I'm saying, \"What is the constitutional basis of private courts?\" I'm saying again: \"What law, which clause, in which law, is the right to defend in some special authorities? What law system and what law does such a thing exist? And I continue: is it considered to be a punishment for abuse of duty by the judges, the law and the Constitution, the attempts to restrict the right to a fair trial, the actions that ignore defence? The answer is: So I am a member of the Justice Commission. I know the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the Constitution, the law. I don't know what's in accordance with the rules of the Constitution and the Civil Code when I'm drafting a question proposal, and the man at the General Directorate of Laws and Decisions knows a lot more than I do, and he says: What part of this question is related to the use of judicial authority? Is it the use of judicial authority to say that private courts operate according to what Article of the Constitution? <p> Today, Mr. Secretary is bringing an arrangement under the name \"reform\" to the judiciary, where he says the right to defend can't be restricted in private court. <p> I, too, have no regulation to limit the right to defend the existing laws. What do you do that according to? It's clouding the judgment. <p> Friends, to influence the judiciary is that if he makes a statement when he uses his judicial authority on the basis of the case, he will influence the judiciary, which means that the Prime Minister and other ministers will be able to influence the decision made in the Hrant Dink case. <p> Today the control authority of the Turkish Parliamentary Assembly cannot be handed over to officers in the General Directorate of Laws and Decisions, which has been handed over. <p> That's why I'm taking a stand against the position of Parliament Speaker. The right to control is restricted.\n",

Lawyers are the founding elements of the judiciary, with great contributions to justice, and are the integral elements of the independent judiciary and the modern legal system. Our lawyers also carry out an important task for the functioning of social relations. With these important tasks, our lawyers have strengthened the trust of citizens in the state and have made a valuable contribution to organizing state-state relations. Of course, defence is the founding factor of the judiciary, and law enforcement is an irrefutable profession within the services of justice. Therefore, we continue to view the solution to lawyers' professional problems as part of our goal of justice that is reliable and accessible to strengthen the defence's resources. <p> At this point, the Judicial Reform Strategy Document, which makes up our road map in our legal policies, has been prepared to consider the opinions and suggestions of lawyers and barmen. With great interest from our fellow lawyers, the expectations of meeting, e-reportation, special-marked passport rights have been met. In order to ensure the defence's active participation in trials, the UYAP update on the access of lawyers has been implemented to the information and documents in the investigation file. In our legal system, Bars have been given many tasks in the participation of lawyers in public service. Bars aim to maintain and improve professional solidarity, cooperation, professional discipline and professional ethics. Legal regulations have also been made in order to ensure that bar services are conducted in a healthier manner and that the delays in processing the process be eliminated. With these regulations, the effective and efficient provision of services provided by the Bars, the ability of lawyers to come together to conduct their professional activities better, to make them more qualified, and the training given to lawyers in the beginning and in the course of the profession has been made more qualified. On the basis of all the innovations that we've done so far, and on the basis of what we're going to do after that, we see our differences in every color and pattern as a wealth of... <p> ...to protect the rights of 84 million of our people, the law. <p> On this occasion, I congratulate all our lawyers on April 5th, Lawyer's Day. <p> I salute you all again.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the National Party of Movement on part one of the First Amendment bill in Law Incompatibility Number 233. I salute your high council. <p> Dear lawmakers, we, the National Movement Party, are not opposed to the establishment of a mediating mechanism as an alternative solution to law conflicts. In many countries around the world, it is important that this system, which exists in our culture, is created as a more common and legal mechanism, which aims to resolve problems through compromise. Today, in inter-wife disputes, family elders are trying to resolve these problems through peace, as well as through governors, governors, mayors, and commanders, who serve in the area on issues that are important in the field of pay-per-view, such as blood feuds. Again, within our legal system, the Law on Village Law 442, the Law on Oil, Tax Law on the Protection of consumer 4077, the Law on Public Work Conventions, Strike and Lockavt Law, Law on Business Courts No. 5521, Law on Law on Law 6100, and many other regulations have been allowed to compromise. <p> When we look at countries that apply the intermediary system, we see that they are implementing three different models in the world. The first of these applications is in-house models; the second, non-court models; the third, by the court or by the courts. If the model in our country had been chosen within the court or in front of the court, the mediation system would have been more reliable and less critical. If an in-laws system had been chosen again, concerns would have been eliminated that the mediation system would have created a new judicial mechanism outside the judiciary. However, this was not achieved. A similar model of non-court models adopted in Austria and Denmark was adopted. As an institution, the intermediary mechanism is not subject to objections at the point of need for this establishment. One of the main issues of debate and objection in the introduction of the intermediary system is whether these activities are judicial activities? Second, it is the issue of whether the Constitution is contrary or not. The government and the Justice Minister and <PARTY> Group of this government, which brought this bill to your attention, do not see mediating activities as a judicial activity. Well, I'd like to ask the Minister why we're doing this arrangement. Aren't we doing it to reduce the work of the judge? Can we call these activities a commercial activity? Administratorial activity, would you say? Or is it a cultural or agricultural activity? The work is an act of judgment. <p> Mr. Secretary, you're trying to make this work look like a different job to people, as you did before. Look, you set up a radar base for Malatya Globecik, and you said: \"This is not against Iran, this will not protect Israel. What did former French President Sarkozy tell you? We call the cat a cat. Didn't he say so? And please don't tell me these activities have nothing to do with judgment. Of course, we know very well why you call it judicial activity, but why, if you call it judicial activity, it would violate at least a few articles of the Constitution. <p> Dear lawmakers, Mr. Ergin, Minister of Justice says that 6 million cases a year have been turned into case files, and unless the workload is reduced to the courts, we can't eliminate court buildings that are delayed by increasing the number of prosecutors. The judge says and considers alternative conflict solutions as a solution. <p> And we say, as the National Movement Party, that once you've made this arrangement, you can't relieve the burden of the trial. Again, conflicts in the legal state must be addressed by neutral and independent judicial authorities. The excessity of the workload of the judiciary should not be the basis of alternative judgment. <p> Again, the current government, Mr. Secretary, you have to find ways to work faster by maintaining the neutrality and independence of the judiciary. At the beginning of these measures, the number of judges you have said for years has been few must be increased. Again, Mr. Attorney General, do not seek justice only in court and case files. Hand over to the rightful owners what the workers and workers deserve out of the welfare of the officer. Resolve interstate funding and investment injustice. Give up your unfair practices across the country. <p> Dear lawmakers, the Minister does not tell us why the court's workload has increased in enormous proportions, not to mention the flaws of the <PARTY>'s Authority in this increase. The courts are full, let's not send the cases to the courts. He says -- as in the Czech Law -- the prisons are full, let the courts go. But he's not talking about what needs to be done to make independent and neutral courts work faster. <p> Dear lawmakers, we also see that there are some incomplete regulations in this bill, ranking 233. First of all, how do we maintain the neutralness of the mediator when we have not yet fully established the neutrality and independence of the judiciary? There is no regulation in the bill. While the mediator should be considered a public official in implementing the Penal Code, there is no regulation on this application. The intermediary process is an undiagnosed process. If the negotiator abuses his position again, there's no telling what will happen. A lack of regulation and sanctions has been one of the key flaws in the arrangement. We're looking for a law school graduate condition to be a negotiator, communication techniques, negotiations and conflict solutions, behavioral psychology, and since the media won't do what the judge does, since they won't do the material law and they won't be able to decide, so we're looking for a law school graduate condition to be a negotiator, which is not clear. I think it's unfair that such an arrangement has been made so that only law graduates can become mediators, even though our people who graduated from tens of thousands of economies and administrative sciences and other schools are out of work on the streets. Of course, I also think the logic of this arrangement is a compromise given by the bar to accept the mechanism of mediation. <p> Dear lawmakers, is it possible that this system will again be used for multi-lawy or for those who want to judge in their own ethnic court? In this respect, this law must be studied more carefully. <p> As a final statement, as well as performances in countries with applications in the world, the mediation system appears to be a provision that carries with it many hesitations, that does not reduce the burden of the judiciary, that even in countries where the practices exist, the citizens have no knowledge of the system, but should be introduced as a global imperative. <p> In any case, I wish this arrangement to be a blessing to our nation.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on the 11th amendment to the Military Penal Code and to some Laws. I salute your high council. <p> The AK PARTY has destroyed centuries of institutions since its arrival. The harp schools shut down the academy. Destroyed centuries of traditions. They've turned the law into a puzzle board, constantly changing it, doing nothing else. It's not really a tradition or a respectable infrastructure. <p> In military treatment, you shut down the GATA, military hospitals, who taught soldiers who were wounded in the war from the highest stage. Now, it's pathetic, civilian hospitals don't have enough savings in this treatment. You don't even get the opinion of the soldiers for the bill you brought in, I did it, it happened. You're acting as usual. You have not received the opinion of the Retired Officers' Association for this bill, nor have you received the views of union organisations in the field of national defence because you are as closed to different opinions, pluralism, constructive criticism as ever. This bag of 20 articles, which have changed seven different laws, you've brought the law to our attention. There is also a change in the Law Against the Returning Capital Agency in the Military Hospitals. In fact, the restoration of the GATA is the responsibility of the soldier's treatment, the duty of military physicians. I personally don't think it's right for us to eliminate an example of our work on this subject. It's obvious that the military hospital structures that specialize in the active fight against terrorism should be strengthened and continued, and the painting we came from is pathetic. But since the AK PARTI is a government that turns its back on republican institutions, because it's a building that destroys it all the time, how we shut down the sugar factories, now we've opened our hands to get candy from the world, and where we come from, we've made sugar heaven a country that imports sugar, so if it does, the EC PARTI does. <p> Mr. President, dear lawmakers, we're raising the Chief of Staff's mandate to 72 years, and we all know it's against our Constitution, but where we're coming from, with a clause, you're opening the doors again with a dominant clause. The Chief of Staff's mandate is set, appointed once. If the regulation of the proposal becomes law, the office of the General Staff will be removed from merit and will be subject to the president's arbitrary will. This institution seeking expertise for national security cannot be left between the President's two lips. Ataturk has always expressed the secession of military and political affairs and has taken every precaution according to this, whereas the position of Chief of Staff here is personalized, converted into a political vehicle. <p> Mr. President, with the President's arbitrary decision, the extension of the current Chief of Staff's mandate will disrupt the military hierarchy, creating a new tradition that will also cause great difficulties in the post-assignment system. <p> Again, with this proposal, the rules of law are being slaughtered, and a soldier is being tried for reasons such as desertion and permit rape. This is a violation of the right of defense. <p> Again, we're looking at this bill, and I'm afraid we've forgotten again the method in which our petty officers receive degrees and degrees, which has completed at least two years and longer higher education. In this way, we're denying 2,000 high school-educated petty officers who are already on the job. Come, let's give it up while the road is near, and eliminate the deprivation of 2,000 of our Petty Officers. <p> Although partial improvements to the rights of military personnel have been made by the proposal, the subject of criticism has not been taken into account when we look at it as a whole. In particular, the drama of senior majors and majors who try to survive under the age of hunger and have no other country in the world is not solved here. <p> An unfair arrangement and a priced military arrangement, my friends. We're bringing in a Bedelli soldier, and the price of the military is 56,500 lira, but the roll call will pay $9,418 extra per year for every single year. If you've passed the banks, there's a one-day delay in the banks if there's a delay in the bank, but there's an extra year's delay in a day's delay, it's unacceptable. You're bringing in an unfair system with $9.418, and I say we drop it. <p> Mr. President, the precious Regents, the inequality of martyrs and veterans' salaries is not being compensated here again. In 2007, however, the decision was made to pay a net minimum wage for those who received an honorary pension but had no social security and were not employed. Unfortunately, the other veterans who pay taxes are not paid the same amount. It is imperative that the veteran's wages be evened. <p> Cypriot veteran children are not given jobs. In addition to an interest-free mortgage for the veterans, the lack of a green passport continues here as well. Come on, let's solve this within the framework of the law. <p> I recently went to Şırnak for my party assignment, where the mother of Sekine, who had martyred her son to the PKK in 1994, said that her martyr's salary was $2,200 and that she could not live on this $2,200 in exchange for inflation, but that she had made one of her remaining children to teach at the educational institute. It broke my heart when he expressed the problems he was facing. <p> Come on, let's raise the wages of both our martyr mothers and our fallen fathers, to the extent that they deserve the martyrs and veterans' wages. (HPP applause in rows) To end the inequalities, injustices between their salaries, I salute the High Assembly with respect.\n",
