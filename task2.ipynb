            "Text: Thank you, Mr. President. <p> Of course, since it's the Justice Commission, the Minister of Justice is here, which is actually an arrangement that concerns the Department of Labor. For him, Mr. Mehmet Mush has just responded here, breaking the rules, instead of the government, as he is the Deputy Director of the Group, but he doesn't know anything. After all, I'm already telling Mr. Mush, and I want him to come and answer -- I'm not going to stick to my speech on matter, I prepared him -- because in his speech, we, the <PARTY>, have done a lot for the workers for the past five years. <p> I mean, do we live in a different country? <p> Dear friends, I would argue that the <PARTY> has not made or passed a single clause in favor of the worker in 15 years. After this conversation, Mehmet Mush will come up here and we'll pass this clause. He says, \"You'll witness it here.\" I'll tell you: when they first arrived in 2002, they first changed the Law on Business Safety. Ten people and those who worked on them took advantage of them, and they brought them in as thirty men and those who worked on them. Two: They changed the Work Law, imposed flexible work, part-time work on the workers. Three: They sent the workers into retirement in the tomb, and raised their pension age to 65. Four: In the process, they banned the strikes. They banned 13 strikes, robbed the workers, the workers, the workers' rights. Business murders have increased exponentially. In the process, 19,000 workers died. You passed the Health and Safety Act until today, when the Law on Occupational Health and Safety came out, you postponed it last year, you postponed it at the request of employers. The number of workers who died in these five months alone is 734, not counting the remaining months in the first five months. You've passed the law of contracting modern slavery, re-creating the labor trade. When you arrived in the public and private sector, there were about 350,000 people -- including the municipalities -- the number of subcontractors over 2 million, you converted them into subcontractor republics. You postponed the Law on Health and Safety, which I just told you. <p> Mr. Attorney General, one more thing I want to say from here, you're here. You know, 301 people were murdered, killed in Soma, and the case continues, but a tragic event occurred, and the judge was dismissed from the case file, changed. The new judge is going to look at that file again, he's going to extend the process again, and we're having trouble understanding that. The lawsuits of the firework explosion in Davutpaşa and the illegal tube explosion in Ostimim are still under way. <p> Look, even the juvies of September 12 had laid off 4,300 people, but the trail was clear to the employees who had been laid off, but you, after this July 20th State procedure, laid off about 136 thousand people and closed their case routes. This is all happening in your time. <p> You ransacked the unemployment fund, which was built for the workers, and you ransacked the employers. You've agreed to collect tribute from workers, laborers, in the name of mandatory individual pensions. Now that you've taken an interest in the 80-year-old Senior Vengeance Fund, we know that you've been working on bringing him to this House in the shortest possible process. <p> This is the new arrangement that eliminates the employee's right to go to court. By bringing in the mandatory mediation system, you are guiding the employer to an arrangement that will put the worker in a position of victimhood in the face of a powerful employer. (Applause from <PARTY> rows) Now you're taking away the employee's right to complain with this bill, the 13th article. You, worker, can only complain to the employer as long as you work, and you cannot complain to the employer while you leave. That's not very true, dear friends. Because only after the worker leaves work can he complain. When he complains while working, business inspectors ignore the unfair practices of the employer, fearing that he will be the first employee to be laid off when they arrive at that factory. You brought this arrangement back in 2011, and it was very good. From 2011 to today, there were only 125 thousand complaints. 120,000 complaints were inspected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and even though there were many workers who were fired, they helped the workers inside. <p> So, pull this arrangement. <p> And Mr. Mush, we're curious, for God's sake, tell us what the <PARTY> has done for that worker in these 15 years, come, if the President promises, it's yours. <p> Thank you very much.\n",

If he fails to be faithful to the writer, the unchanging truth will be a marvel to mankind. <p> On July 15, 2016, in the first hour of the treasonous coup attempt, we face all kinds of coups, we stand by the legitimate government. It is our leader, Mr. Dr. State Bahli Özakça, who came out of his house to his position in the party, to reveal his address to the traitor and to declare it open and public, who opposed the coup and changed the political balances, and who began to enter all the televisions as subtitles by which his statement began to enter into the streets by encouraging the citizens. Mr. Necdet, I wish he'd told me a little bit about this in a book about that night with all the 707 pages of detail he'd prepared. <p> Mr. President, the esteemed lawmakers have been authorized by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey to exchange information, which is personal and commercially confidential outside of health data, with the consent of the person who is notarized or provided by notarized by the person or by the person who is allowed to submit information on e-government application under the law, including the public administration and statistical data specified in Article 5502. The Central Bank has announced that it will use this data to analyse the impact of these issues. <p> Again, it is possible that the Social Security Agency will be able to share personal health data with the Ministry of Health. <p> The 19th article of the proposal was drafted to encourage the production of electric motor automotive in Turkey, adding a temporary 12th article to Law 5520. These firms are entitled to receive the ETV tax due to their first pension, which they paid as part of a discounted corporate tax tax (32/A) under Article 32/12/2015, as part of the IRS Act (32/A). We find tax support for such companies that will contribute greatly to our country's economy positive. <p> During the election of June 24, 2018, our leader, Mr. Doctor State Bahçeli, declared that the best province for the establishment of the local automotive facility in Turkey is Konya. As a matter of fact, the research of the Turkish Republic's Mevlana Development Agency, the Conium Chamber of Industry, the Conium Chamber of Commerce, the Conium Trade Exchange, the Conium Organised Industry Region, the Otomotival Producing Fizibility Report, supported by the Ministry of Development of the Republic of Turkey, has been found to be the most appropriate province between eight provinces. This investment will also help the shipping companies operating in our country to contribute to our economy, as well as to the employment problem of the provinces and the provinces around it. <p> Under the 20th article of the proposal, the amount of tuition per exit from our citizens of the Republic of Turkey who have left the country is raised from 15 TL to 50 TL. <p> The 21st article of the law proposal is also related to the 14th article. In addition to the 1st article of the Anti-Trafficking Act 5607, it is intended to be returned to the owners of vehicles under investigation or prosecution under the third joke of Article (2) of Article III of the Anti-Trafficking Law, who have not been given a warrant, to be applied to the customs administration until 31/12/2019, and to be paid in the first period, 25 per cent more well-intentioned third persons have been protected by the fact that the EV (OTV) has been paid within a month. <p> Law 4458 states that there will be demands again, given the use of 2,654 vehicles in 2017 from Law 1,260, 5607. But there's one thing to be careful about here. The determination of third parties with good intentions during the implementation of the law requires maximum care. To avoid abuse, maximum caution is required. <p> The regulation of the law proposal, issued in Articles 22, 23, 24, has been arranged to prevent the registration of around 70 million mobile phones registered to the Mobile Device Recording System, which has been registered in the Mobile Recording System for more than seven years without signaling, thus preventing the registration of illegal phones. In addition, these types of recordings are allowed to be shared between operators and the company's Mobile Device Recording System so that telephone operators may be able to prevent fraud from selling the device with the line. Such sharing of information should not be ignored if there are problems ahead. Again, electronic identity information has been altered, meaning that the cloned devices will be blocked within four months of the period when the substance is in effect, but can be reused by the amount of $250 a year's application period. <p> Under the 25th article of the proposal, it is envisioned that the staff of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey's Executive Service and those in charge of the National Government of Palaces can be appointed to the National Government of the Palaces by protecting their rights. <p> It has been decided that due to the fact that Law 6361 has been added to Article 16 and there is no way to collect a specific response after the release of the document, the payment will be worthless under Article 322 of the Tax Code. <p> In Article 27 of the Law Proposal, the extension of Article 6362 in Article 31 (P.S.) is determined to be adopted in the executive courts of bonds exported by the private sector according to Article 68 (P.S.) of the Executive and Bankruption Act. <p> The 28th amendment to public-private co-operation agreements, based on the principles of public interest, competition and equality, has been ordered to calculate the price of use and the price of service to the user during the operation period through the net current value. <p> Article 29 of the proposal has been changed in Article 4 of Law 6428. The agreement is allowed to change its contracts and supplements with the approval of the Ministry of Health, as long as the contract's costs are not increased in situations of distress due to reasons or circumstances affecting the contract. <p> The Law's 30th Article (6428) of the Law shall be added to Article 6428, with the right to use Article III (9) joke of Article 4 (9) in the agreements adopted prior to the date of implementation of the article. <p> The 31st article of the proposal extends a hundred and twenty days to those who have been cut off from their unlicensed energy production projects. It is necessary to include those who can't benefit from other than that right. <p> In Article 32 of the Proposal, some regulations are made for the public benefit of the Electric Market Law. The fact that this material will be applied to retroactive operations may affect the parties. <p> Article 33 of the proposal and Article 12 (7) of Article 6569 (7) opened the way for the employment of qualified staff members of the academics who have been assigned to the Turkish Institute of Health to continue to be paid by the financial, social, rights and assistance of the academics who have been transferred from the university. <p> The 34th and 35th articles of the proposal are the activation clauses. <p> Mr. President, the esteemed MPs of the great Turkish nation, our House will soon be on vacation, and we will return to our constituencies and continue our work there. But if we were told something like this, Meclis is going on vacation, but every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, we're going to have General Assembly meetings, and you're going to have to go back to the commission meetings. And we say, \"What kind of holiday is this?\" But we live it as a profession. There's a holiday and a law on our behalf, there's a Law on Financial Relation 5604. <p> Mr. President, I'm completing. <p> And while there's a holiday, we make a statement on July 26th, and when there's no holiday, we make a statement on July 26th. <p> I salute our Veteran Assembly and the great Turkish nation watching us on their screens.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the National Movement Party Group on the 1st article of the proposed proposal. On this occasion, I salute you all. <p> Dear friends, last night, as you all know, three of our soldiers were killed in Şanlıurfa. In addition to this report, the governorate issued a statement saying three of our soldiers serving in a guardhouse on the Syrian border had been fired on by PKK and PYD forces. This was later corrected, and instead of the PKK and the PYD, three of our soldiers were reported to have been killed by a fire made by unidentified persons. We've just met with a family of martyrs, and they say and say similar things during meetings with their fellow soldiers there. And when the question was raised earlier, Mr. Secretary probably tried to enlighten us by reading a text he had received from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Of course, we want to believe this explanation. But it turns out that in light of the information collected and the initial explanations, it's a matter worth examining, investigating. Hopefully, the military prosecutor's investigation will bring this to light. But my conclusion is that there's a blackout going on so that the solution process doesn't get damaged, and if these facts are hidden, I'd like to say it's not the right thing to do. <p> Dear friends, Turkey is surrounded by fire. There's a fire in us too. We're looking around, and the Middle East geography is reshaping. Syria, Iraq, is on fire. The only hegemonic force is shaping the region. In this new era of formation, we also face a situation as if it were a duty to welcome those who fled. So we're out of the area. Unfortunately, in a month's time, we were cut off from Friday's prayer in Damascus, while in the war in Syria for many years. We're out of the equation. No one's paying any attention to us. We're completely excluded from the area. It's like we're in a numerically zero position on the left. There is no one who considers us and intends to impose a burden on us. <p> Dear friends, it's no different in there, and inside, it's like a firehouse. Turkey is actually facing a great deal of trouble. We quickly forgot about the events that happened about 45 or 50 days ago on October 6th, 7th. What was the result of these events on October 6th, 7th? It's an ongoing negotiation, there's no telling what's being discussed in the negotiation, no one knows what's being given, no one knows who's getting it. Let alone the public, even the lawmakers have no knowledge of this, and after the al-ver debates at this negotiating table, the great events took place in Kobani as an excuse, we lost 50 people, and there were so many terrible things that people got goose bumps in the process. Can you imagine, two of our soldiers came from behind and were killed by a bullet in the back of their necks? In Diyarbakir, our soldier was shot in the back of the head while his wife was with him. Imagine how a man can kill a man with a wife, behind his back, and put a bullet in his head? With what emotion can he do that? How do you get the feeling that you might have the courage to do something like this? This is Turkey. What this tells us, what it tells us, is that you're talking to me on the other side of the organization negotiating table. You have lots of promises, lots of promises. You're gonna make it happen. Otherwise, that's what you're going to face. He's using Kobani as an excuse to take action against the Turkish nation and its state. <p> Dear friends, what's going to happen to us now, for God's sake? I mean, what more can we live with? So what else is going to happen to us, other than the situation Turkey faced on October 6th 7th, but why would Turkey have reason to understand what circumstances, what situation it is facing? Let us not forget that these events are actually the result of a work done. You pull them into the military barracks, lock them in there by order of the governor, lock the police in the police station, and if there's a social event, they'll come out, they'll spray the streets, cities, to the PKK, and they'll cut off the road. Just two days ago, he was showing it on TV, in Diyarbakir, they're doing ID checks, they're doing driver's license checks, right under your nose, they're declaring autonomy in Cizre, ditchs are dug in front of the neighborhoods, armed people are standing guard, and they're being broadcast on websites. In this case called the deformation process, with the withdrawal of the state power, there is a new structure of the organization facing the people, where the state has been moved from here. For him, the people who need to take part and take position in this new structure are getting a little closer to the organisation, allowing the masses to grow more and more massive. <p> Dear friends, there was a football match held on Sunday in Van. Two days ago, the Bergamaspian player scored a goal, and after all the games we've seen, we've always seen, we've gotten used to, and we've always scored a goal, he and Bergamasporan football players barely survived the lynching of Van Stadium. How does that feel, guys? Isn't that an important collaborative that explains the sense of division in the heads? <p> In Tunceli, the organisation declared a ban on hunting, and pressured the community with the threat of killing those who did not comply. <p> All of these landscapes, all of these events, reveal the state of Turkey when it was being pulled out of the region under the process of decontamination, while the state was resetting its existence. <p> What does our Prime Minister say? The public order is essential. Without public order, there is no solution process. Good afternoon, good morning. It's as if another government has ruled Turkey for twelve years, as if people have come from another satellite for twelve years and assumed control of Turkey. Without public order, there would be no peace. That's what the Prime Minister says. <p> Dear friends, from the public order of a member of the delegation who met with Apoka yesterday, we do not understand what the government understands, he said. Again, yesterday, the head of a party made a similar statement similar to that of Kobani, who said that if this law was brought up with reasonable doubt regarding the law on security measures, it would go out on the streets, so he threatened it, threatened it. Mr. Prime Minister answers today, we're having a peace conference, while the president of this party repeats what he's done before, and he's not smart at all. So you have to wait for him to say those words to find out that he's not getting any smarter? <p> Dear friends, the appetite is heightened, the buttermilk is swollen, and the prospect of waiting for a future in the peace process when people in that part of society are in a position and in a position to want bigger things will be no more than a raw dream, and the plague will be too heavy for both those who walk and Turkey. <p> Yes, dear friends, I was actually prepared to speak on the matter of the law, but there was so much said that I didn't feel the need to say anything. <p> I salute you all.\n",

            "Text: Honourable President, highly valued lawmakers, our esteemed citizens who are watching us on television, on behalf of the <PARTY> Party, I salute you all with respect and conversation. <p> You know, tomorrow, National Sovereignty and Children's Day, the 102nd year of the opening of the Grand National Assembly, the representative of the national will. I remember Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of the national struggle, and all the mebus who came from all over Asia Minor and shouldered the First Assembly with respect and mercy. <p> April 23, 1920... a shattered empire under the occupation of the capital, a generation running from the front to the front for decades, a nation guiding history is in danger of extinction. In contrast, a handful of people who have not given up hope and determined to remove the shackles of freedom and the future of our nation, who, in the most difficult of circumstances, have waged a national struggle without compromise, without speaking too loudly, with common minds and consultations, have determined the future of the country. Today, however, we have left a hundred and two years behind, but we are far behind in our Veteran Assembly, with the awareness of being the deputy of every nation concerned about these values and the woes of every citizen. <p> My dear nation, Turkey is today trying to be ruled by a oppressive, authoritarian understanding that threatens everyone. Evil has become ordinary, moral corruption, lawlessness, nepotism, corruption, and, as a result, poverty continues to grow. We are getting poorer and poorer every day because of the loss of all values, the fact that power has strayed from my sanity and embraces oppressive and arbitrary governance. Inflation is in an uncontrollable dimension, the increases don't slow down, the cost of life has become unbearable, our citizens are desperate. We have young people who can't do their professions, who can't be assigned, who are depressed and commit suicide because they can't see the future, who, in many places, close the day of our shop, who are forced to collect fruits and vegetables from the markets. <p> Ladies and gentlemen of the law, I invite you all to consider the day of the declaration of national sovereignty as a gift to the children. We need to think about what kind of country we're going to bequeath to our children and face the responsibility. Are we going to leave a country that resembles a prison for our children? Did we imagine a country where man was made worthless, where abuse and torture became ordinary? Are we going to inherit a lawless state concept, concrete cities, a bad education system and poverty? We're going to leave you a country where you're forbidden to ask questions, argue, and pursue a life that will make you happy? Leave a country where our children will want to run away when they become adults? <p> We really don't deserve to have the most unhappy children in Turkey among the 41 countries that belong to the EU and the OECD. Today, when we ride a bicycle in Turkey, we have children who are crushed to death under Panzers, children who have been blown to bits in empty fields, children who grew up in prison with their mother, thousands of children who were branded terrorists at the moment of their birth, hundreds of thousands of children who have been imprisoned for their families. The representatives of power must see these facts and meditate on them together. <p> Dear friends, I would like to end my words with an anecdote from Aliya Izetbegovic. In the days when more than 100,000 Bosniak people were killed, hundreds of thousands of people were homeless, mosques, houses, hospitals were destroyed, Aliya says: \"To be human and to remain human is our responsibility to God and to ourselves. <p> According to him, these two concepts mean trying to form a state that gives people political confidence and peace, accepts justice and the superiority of law, and that no one has to be discriminated against and persecuted because of its diversity. Being human and being human, I guess there's no worse loss than that. I wonder if there's any value left to be feared of losing after you've lost your ability to be sure and trust and peace around you. And here we are, with the support of millions of our troubled citizens in this dark time, fighting to save our country from this tyrant, who is suffering from a state of mind and conscience. I truly believe that this struggle will result in victory for the entire community, that we will build Turkey, the land of the peaceful and happy people who do not divide and oppress anyone else. <p> And I regret to say that we will remember this power-drunk power-drunk power-drunk power-driving power, this power that doesn't even know it's taking the country to the brink of a precipice, and we will remember it with countless evils. <p> On behalf of the <PARTY> Party, I salute you all with respect and conversation.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute your grand delegation. <p> I would like to address the negative effects of coal-powered thermal power plants in the most living cities, despite the fact that the new thermal plants are a province planned to be built, and the negatives that Zonguldak (Zonguldak) has experienced in this regard, and our people's views on the matter. <p> Work continues to be established after four thermal plants operating in Zonguldak. A total of 4,580 megawatts of electricity is planned to be produced in the region, along with two planned thermal plants. Three new thermal plants are being asked to be built, and I'll make it very clear, it's a murder designed. In a very narrow space, we're talking about over 10 million tons of coal-burning power plants. There is no other example of this in the world. Even if the entire production capacity of the Zonguldak coal basin under 1 million tons is activated, it won't cover consumption. So we've built coal and thermal plants from Russia and other countries, and we'll continue to build them. <p> In this period, the introduction of the privatisation of TTK mines is also a trap to obtain new thermal power plant permission. This is an effort to turn the coal basin into a folded-up address for imported coal. These plants will work with imported coal again. <p> Dear lawmakers, even the current thermal power plants can't continue to work this way, and if new ones are added, our people will either be left here to die or leave the land where they were born. <p> Thermal plants damage public health, environment, other environments, and agriculture and production in the region. Our people have made it clear that they know enough about power plants and that they have learned to live with their loss. You're going to do these projects in spite of the public? What more do we have to do to make you hear the voices of the people who live here? <p> Zonguldak becomes a city that has a green paradise, but has lost its properties more and more because of thermal plants, where people have lost their health, where birds and bees don't even live. This is directly linked to Zonguldak's being one of Turkey's dirtiest areas in terms of particle matter pollution. Unfortunately, as Zonguldans, we're in trouble with these coal power plants. The companies who used all the possibilities of Zonguldak, but left Zonguldak with only disease, death and contaminated air, water, land, are in good spirits because they're profitable, and our people are concerned about life. <p> Companies who want to build thermal power plants make the project companies and so-called scientists tell the environment that they can't hurt people without being embarrassed or bored. They insist that the coaled thermal plant has no harm to nature, and they say they will take every precaution not to create pollution, and they want us to believe that. So, the valued lawmakers somehow fit the business into the book and illegally build the plant. In doing so, they abuse the effort to bring bread to people's homes. Because we're going to create an alliance. They're trying to fool people with their minds. Thermal plants, as thought, do not create jobs, many of them come from the country where technology is being acquired. In Zonguldak, workers from China are working. <p> Today, who can tell you that the smoke from thermal plants does not harm the environment and public health, and that the waste from here to the middle of the sea is safe, that it does not kill living creatures in the sea? According to OECD reports, 29 people died last year in Turkey due to air pollution. That's six times the number of people who died in traffic accidents. Because of disease and death, coal power plants have a burden on the country's economy of 9-9.5 billion dollars per year. That's 10% of all health care expenses. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanism, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Health, and other relevant ministries are not in co-operation, dialogue and co-ordination on issues that have common denominators. <p> Dear MPs, 1/100 made by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanism. The 5,000-scale environmental layout plan has been agreed that it would be appropriate to address thermal plants in the Zonguldak-Bartin-Karabuk planning area, particularly in the Filios Valley, in the strategy principle that they should be directed to appropriate areas that are environmentally and ecologically vulnerable. <p> Filyos Valley is a bird's paradise. Of the 478 bird species detected in Turkey, 301 live in Zonguldak. The thermal plant to be built here will damage the entire Filios basin irreversibly. For these reasons, these thermal plants can't be built on Filios. No more Zonguldak, my lords. <p> My respects to all of you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, I have made a pledge on behalf of my party on the first part of the First Amendment to some Laws by Mr. Mustafa Elias. I salute you all. <p> In particular, we replace dozens of laws that concern the Taxes Act, but are not related to each other at all. <p> First of all, Mr. Elitaş's Law on Taxes and the Law on Making Changes in Some Laws was submitted to the Plan and Budget Commission on February 8th as 16 articles, and on February 9, 2017, the Plan and Budget Commission was called to discuss. But on the same dates, on February 9th, Mr. Prime Minister Bali gives the bill of law to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for the amendments to certain Laws and Laws under the Act of Taxes, and is referred to Plan and Budget on February 13th. <p> So, both the Prime Minister -- the Council of Ministers -- and <PARTY> Kayseri MP and Deputy Director of the Group, Mr. Elitaş, who is unaware of each other's proposal for law, has been offered to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and is referred to the Plan and Budget Commission. <p> Now, can you think about it, friends? I mean, there's a government that runs the country, and there's a group of vice presidents who are always co-ordinated with the government. One is offered to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey as an offer, and one is 16 and 19 articles, both of which are joint friends, but one is not aware of each other. <p> For what it's worth, I'm telling you, lawmaking, legislature duties are so bad that even between the ruling party's Prime Minister and the group's deputy, there's such a gap that they don't know about each other that they're giving a bill and a proposal to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, and we have to discuss it in Parliament. <p> Now, he's come to the Plan and Budget Commission, and we've put aside the government's bill, and we've started to discuss the bill that Mr. Elias gave us as 16 articles. Of course, many of the bag laws that have been passed so far have made arrangements in the 15-year period of the <PARTY> government called restructurings again and again. The first one was done in 2003, then in 2006, then again in 2008, again in 2009, again in 2011, in 2011, in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, during the 15-year period of <PARTY>'s rule, both in income tax and in social security and other laws -- including a tax -- has made complete restructures or 11 re-organisations under the name Lailaaf. <p> And why is that needed? First of all, it was done once every three years, and then every day, it's been two years, and it's been a year lately, my friends. Every year, reconstructions are made. <p> Look, we've made an arrangement about this in January, we've made an arrangement in December, but it's not enough, now we're re-arranged on our way to the referendum, and we're re-resolving for both the stamp tax and the non-inflicted businessmen. <p> Why do we often have to make such adjustments? The first reason is that, for once in Turkey, both the income tax and the institutional tax must be re-examined, and Turkey must be restored to a fair tax system. <p> So why can't our businessmen, our industrialists, our shopkeepers, our citizens pay their taxes? One: either Turkey has a serious moral breakdown, people don't pay taxes, they win but they don't. Two: Business is very bad, really bad, and because he can't do business, he can't pay his taxes, he can't pay his insurance, he doesn't pay the social security premium for his staff. <p> So, because things aren't going well, there's always these kind of configurations, and there's always the biggest disadvantage of these configurations, and there's always going to be a pardon, and there's going to be an arrangement on the way to the election anyway, where there's going to be a decent, moral, real sector, where there's a huge contribution to Turkey's economy, the industrialists and businessmen pay their taxes, pay their insurance by the penny, pay their money, and pay their stamp, but there's no one on the other side who makes it a tradition. It's also a huge disadvantage for our decent, moral businessmen. <p> In this arrangement, there is now an arrangement for our honest, moral, tax-paying businessmen that will not exceed about a million TL5 per cent. Is it bad? Good. Well, that's not the way it's supposed to be. They should be rewarded, our tax-paying people, our businessmen, our industrialist, they should be rewarded, that's true, but beyond this reward, why are we not really taxed, why do we always have to make an arrangement on them? <p> The proposal is restructuring agricultural loans from the Agriculture Bank and Agriculture Loan Co-ops, which are being used as of December 31st, 2016, in their follow-up accounts. There will also be restructuring for previous reconstructed loans. Agriculture Bank's agricultural loans totalled 43 billion liras, followed by 395 million liras. Agriculture Loan Co-operatives' agricultural loans are $7.5 billion, and 360 million in follow. So, for our farmer, there are good arrangements for our peasant. <p> Again, there is an arrangement concerning TEDAS, which subscribers do not pay due to electricity used in agricultural irrigation. Our fellow lawmakers are going to have some serious talks about this. <p> There's a Pub. In the Plan and Budget Commission on the Plan and Budget Commission, the valued representative of the Turkish Trade and Artists Confederacy came and spoke, and we had such a request, but there was no relationship with us about the drafting of this bill, and we do not agree with the content of it because it says in it: \"The tradesman pays 2 percent of it in the face, and the state will contribute one percent.\" He said, and our friend, who came to represent the Union of Traders and Artists of Turkey, the Secretary General of Turkey, who represents the Union of Arts and Artists. Whether it's reduced to one hundred and one-and-a-half, he's offered to do it, but unfortunately neither our proposals nor TESK's proposals have been accepted. <p> Now, dear friends, into this arrangement, the first verse (b) of Article 4 of Law 5510 is included. Who's in this dam, fellas? The offer already includes all other freelance professions, except for jockeys, trainers, and managers. For example, there are lawyers who go in there, there are notaries who go in there, there are physicians who go in there, and there are dentists, friends. There are approximately 100,000 lawyers in Turkey, friends. I don't know how many of them are in public, how many of them work for their personal account, but now an important part of the lawyers will automatically be a member of the Ahilik Ark, my friends. Now, he's not a tradesman, he's a lawyer, he's a doctor, he's not a tradesman, he's not a notary salesman, but with this arrangement, they'll have to be registered and they'll have to pay a premium here. Well, now that you have a doctor, a financial advisor, we have friends who are dentists. Do you guys agree to be tradesmen? It's not, you're a public servant, you're doing business for yourself out there, but now, you're going to have to automatically, forced entry into this Archipelago. Now, it's not an acceptable attitude and behavior to record all of this into the Ark of Harmony without talking to their social parties, without their consent, without their approval, without their approval, without their approval. They had to be interviewed and spoken to, given their approval so that it could be carried out. <p> Again, in this arrangement, I would like to say that the penalty for not being able to benefit from one year-long incentives to businesses that are particularly uninsuranced workers or reportedly not actually working is reduced to one month. The arrangement will pave the way for illegal, uninsured, under-payment labor, increase job killings. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Security data in February 2017, Turkey has already had an off-the-book employment rate, 33 per cent. With this offer, this arrangement will increase illegal labor. Again, this arrangement will open the way for uninsured workmen under minimum wage. In addition, a situation that deepens the way of employment, both unsecured and social and non-supervised, will bring it to our attention. This is another version of an incentive policy that runs through workers through workers. <p> In short, there's a lot of stuff in this arrangement that we support. <p> But basically, there are elements that we disagree with. Further on, our friends will share their views on the matter. <p> Thank you.\n",

As the Ministry of Customs and Trade, from domestic trade to foreign trade, from customs to logistical centers, from trafficking to resuscitation to the economy, from trade and artists to cooperatives, from consumer rights to market control and control, we have taken on important powers and tasks in many areas. <p> Our priorities as a ministry are to facilitate legal trade, to fight illegal trade more effectively, reduce bureaucratic procedures stemming from customs transactions, to minimise transaction costs, to increase the competitiveness of our trade acquaintances in domestic and foreign trade, thus making our country an easier and safer trading centre. We focused our work on projects and activities based on electronic systems, which speed up border crossings so that all operations can be completed as quickly and as reliable as possible. <p> In 2015, there were 8 million 303,275 vehicles from all our gates, 113 million 481,318 passengers entering and exiting. Through our customs, in 2015, we also collected 84 billion,851 million liras, which correspond to 20.82 per cent of our country's central government tax revenues. In 2015, our 69,330 firms exported and our 77,077 companies exported and totaled a total of 351 billion dollars in foreign trade volumes. Today our country is exporting to 220 countries. In 2002, when we exported over $1 billion, we exported over $1 billion in 31 products in 2015. In 2002, the number of countries we exported over $1 billion increased from 8 to 32. In 2002, we had five cities exporting over $1 billion, and today we had 15 cities. <p> We open Turkey's doors to the world, especially when someone is writing scenarios to close Turkey with holes in its shell. We're renovating our customs doors based on increased foreign trade volumes, needs and demands, and we're turning them into full automation. Recent examples of this are our Dilici and Crazy Aktaş customs doors. In 2016, we will serve the Ringed Customs Directorate and the Esendere Customs Gate. During the following period, we also rebuild the customs doors of Sarp, Hamzabeyli, Gürbulak, Kapaköy and Dereköy. In 2015, we also launched the Office of Gurbulak Customs and Trade District; Bolu, Kütahya, Iğdır, Nüğde, Aktaş Customs Administration. In addition, we have established Adıyaman, Sinop, Army Giresun Airport, Amasian Customs Administration. <p> As the ministry, our goal is to reduce costs in terms of all customs transactions, eliminate stationery, reduce processing time and ensure that the object reaches its final destination as soon as possible. As we side with the Common Transit Convention, where 35 countries are connected with electronic networks, our movers can pass about 5,500km from the east of our country to the west of Europe with a single declaration. <p> With our single-stop work, we'd like to minimize recordings and control procedures in six or seven phases currently at our black border doors. <p> We want to save time and cost in many simplified and accelerated ways, especially with the ease and collateral advantages, in which we can perform export and import transactions at their own facility, with the sanctioned application. <p> The Single Window, also included in the 64th Government Action Plan, stipulates that all required documents be provided at one location and that the transactions be completed with a single-point application. We have integrated 14 institutions and organizations into the Single Window System. <p> As part of our 2016 Action Plan, we are also leading the electronic truck around the world with technical infrastructure for the truck system. In this framework, we launched e-Trip pilot projects with Iran and Georgia. We aim to ensure a safe exchange of data between E-TR projects and national customs systems and other shareholders, and to enable regular, secure, and rapid transfer of goods between countries. For the first time in the world, we've also established inter-tourage data sharing in the Triad System with this project. <p> Recently, we have also implemented the Pre-Existing Passenger Information Project in our country to subject passenger information, which is a sensitive topic for the world's leading countries, to be subject to pre-travel risk analysis. Before arrival, risk assessments are being taken before travel and passenger information are conducted. <p> The vehicle's approval documents have been transferred to electronic media, the transfer notification forms have been transferred into the electronic environment, allowing the value control to be more effective, and the application to be added in the paper environment has been removed. All persons entering our country in private vehicles, especially those living abroad, are allowed to enter the dorm without waiting, with a preliminary statement for personal vehicles brought under tourist conveniences. For this reason, a preliminary statement was created in which individuals recorded information about themselves and their vehicles prior to their travel and were checked by the duty officer when they arrived at the customs gate. <p> The construction of the container and Harbor Tracking System aims to monitor all transactions under the customs administration's electronic system, from the arrival of the stuff entering our country to the ports until it leaves the ports. Through the system, customs audits will increase efficiency, with operations accelerating at the port, the firms will be given the time and cost advantage. <p> With the renovation of our customs labs, the work and processing processes in customs labs are being accelerated, and, as with other customs procedures, all operations in the paper environment are being processed gradually into electronic environments in customs labs. The Laboratory Analysis and Reporting Programme, which was created for this purpose, with the LARA (LARA), is conducted electronically, with the registered customs declaration, the product, and all transactions starting with the lab's love. <p> Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, as a result of our ministry's work in customs, customs transactions have been significantly reduced, while customs transactions of the merchant have been completed faster, saving time and cost. <p> In 2002, three per cent of export statements were processed in the first minute, while in 2015, the rate increased to 64 per cent. The number of declarations completed in the first half-hour was 35 per cent in 2002, while the rate reached 81 per cent in 2015. <p> We see that the average processing period of an export declaration has been significantly shortened compared to the data from 2015 to 2002. In 2002, the transactions of an export statement were approximately ten hours and ten minutes, while it is now two hours and thirty-seven minutes. <p> In 2015, 56 per cent of the customs declaration was processed in the first eight hours and 71 per cent of the transactions were completed within the first 24 hours, and their goods were delivered. <p> Mr. President and valued lawmakers, our aim, in accordance with our foreign policy priorities, is to make our country one of the number of trade centres in which customs services and trade are made easier and safer, to follow active policy on bilateral regional and multilateral international platforms. <p> Due to the negativity in Syria, security measures are at the highest level in our border crossings to this country. We've reinforced our Syrian gates with personnel reinforcements and technical equipment. In this context, objects are fully subject to physical examinations, and they are allowed to enter the country using biometric data and facial scans. We have techs, density measurers, and radioactive matter control systems that allow us to see where the eye can't or can't see. We also use our expert detector dogs on explosive materials at these doors. <p> After developments with Russia, we also contributed as Ministry to measures taken by our government so that our exporters would not be victims. At this point, we also want to say that we can't think of changing the land of this country's land with any commercial activity. <p> We are also contributing to the development of institutional capacities of countries in the region in accordance with our foreign policy. In this scope, in order to fight trafficking more effectively, we sign the 63 customs areas of co-operation and mutual administrative aid agreements that allow direct co-operation with our ministry's other country's customs administrations and the legal infrastructure of the bilateral administrative and technical co-operation. We also continue our technical assistance activities towards Balkan countries, Islamic countries and African countries, particularly Turkish republics. <p> In order to revive the historic Silk Road, our Ministry played a leading role in the launch of the Silk Road initiative between customs administrations along the Silk Road route. With this initiative launched by our Ministry in 2008, the key role of customs administrations in facilitating trade is to take into account the co-operation of customs transactions at the border gates and to be targeted for the use of historical Silk Road to be preferable to trade. <p> Again, the Kervansaray Project, which was carried out by our country's proposal, includes a route along the Silk Road and actions and project facilities aimed at determining the border crossings to work on this route, and then eliminating the elements that prevent border crossings. <p> Mr. President, our efforts in the fight against smuggling, one of the main duties of our ministry, continue effectively and decisively. While fighting smuggling, we also take care that any deviation in our country's economic goals is not slowing down at the speed of trade flow. By closely monitoring technological developments, we're developing both technical devices and systems used in the fight against trafficking as quality and quantity. <p> The vehicle and container speed-scan system was activated for the first time in our country at Izmit Halfca Harbor. The number of X-ray scanning systems has been increased by the vehicle and container scanning systems established at Dilcu and Crazy Aktaş Customs Fields and Tekirdağ Asiaport Harbor. On the other hand, the Habur Customs Field has been established in the area, providing a type of search system, especially used to detect explosives and ammunition. <p> Again, the installation of six luggage-scanners in the last year as part of strengthening our technical capacity, including three units of Dilici, Mad Aktaş Customs Field. <p> Facial recognition systems are used on our black doors. <p> The installation of 18 mobile baggage systems began within March. <p> The purchase of an additional 6,000 mobile units of vehicle tracking vehicles via satellites has been completed and our mobile unit number has been increased to 9.250. <p> In 2014-2015, 10 patrol boats and 25 black patrol cars were taken. <p> Dear friends, our Command Control Center has been completely upgraded to state-of-the-art. In our centre, the fight against smuggling is monitored live for 24 hours, with significant transit points, density, and risky areas. With all this technical infrastructure and these investments in our human resources in 2015... <p> Well, I could tell you a joke if you want.\n",

But it's said here that Kemal Kurkut is involved in everything, but it's not part of the scope of terror by killing Kemal Kurkut, by killing Ali Ismail, by killing Berkin Jon, by appointing trustees at universities, by throwing students out of school for unwarranted, unnecessary, useless reasons. Is that supposed to happen? Where is this definition of terrorism being made by whom in which laboratory, according to what rights, justice, and what humanity? There's no way to accept that. So we say we have an objection. The SEC itself has already lost its legitimacy, and has not contributed to any scientific development, to the capacity, to the development of any university since September 12th, but has taken the university environment, science, and should not be destroyed. This institution has no legitimacy, just like the Head of Religious Affairs, just like the institutions. <p> Anyway, this bag, unfortunately, unfortunately, will pass, and after that, our coven will go on vacation, and soon the Feast of Sacrifice will come. This is the feast of sacrifice, which Abraham Khalillah had done to sacrifice Ishmael for the sake of truth and truth, and dedicated himself to the truth and truth. Come, sacrifice your arrogance, your ego, your separatism and your aberration to justice, law, equality on this Eid. This is the feast of sacrifice, not just an animal sacrifice, but the meaning of the sacrifice itself - not a festival, but a feast of truth and justice. <p> So hold fast to the law for a moment, and hold fast to the truth for a moment, and hold fast to justice, and make your journey to yourselves. You will surely meet with the truth that is hidden in your hearts. Human beings are not just biological beings, Mr. President. Is man an entity of justice, mercy, truth, or zulmat? Whether you will sacrifice your persecution to the truth or not, that is the fundamental issue. This is the way we came to 2023. Will there be truth and justice in 2023, or zulmat in 2023, that is the main issue. It is evident to those who are in favor of injustice, and also to those who are in favor of truth and justice. O ye who walk in the way of truth and justice, do not despair, nor turn back from your way; for the year of equality and justice and truth is 2023. <p> Love and respect.\n",

I'm also celebrating the day of our young angels with Down syndrome. Hopefully, there will be a commission for that in the coming days. I hereby salute all the disabled. <p> Honourable lawmakers, I'd like to give you some information about the jobs and employment of our young people in Turkey. At a time when unemployment, our young population and our country were rapidly developing and developing, we have made significant distances in the 16 years of our young people's employment. According to 2016, 2017 data on the employment of young unemployed persons in the 15-24-year-old group dropped 4.1 per cent and 19.3 per cent. And with the President's call for mobilisation of employment and production, there has been a quick deployment of employment in our organised industries and all of our businesses. If we look at European countries, Turkey has become the country where the most jobs are created and jobs are constantly increasing, young unemployed are reduced. According to 2017 third quarter data, Macedonia is the highest of the young unemployed. The youth unemployment rate was lower on us than on Portugal, Macedonia, Spain, Croatia, France and Greece. So, the basic problems here were said by our speakers just now, in fact, due to a number of shortcomings in our educational system, which can't be combined with theory and practice, and the lack of the professional skills of our young people who have turned to flat schools who can't get vocational education. Because in the past, in order to shut down a school, in order to keep the entire business world away from our educated young people, all vocational high schools have been destroyed in order to shut down imam-hatred schools. <p> Of course, it's going to take time for this to be re-opened, again, to reveal the efficient and trained labor force in this way, but our government, our Ministry of Labor... <p> I'll give you my final word, Mr. President. <p> Mr. President, with our Ministry of Labor, our Ministry of Economics, and all of our ministries, with our Ministry of National Education, I believe that the opening of vocational upper secondary schools in organised industries right now and the collegiate-industrial cooperation will solve this problem, and I hope that in the coming years there will be a Turkey where our young unemployed find more work. <p> I salute you all.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of my <PARTY> Group regarding the budget of the Ministry of Youth and Sports of 2019. As a teenager, we will now discuss your budget with exactly 30 lawmakers in the <PARTY> ranks. It's a good thing we're here to defend your budget for your children and your future. Please listen carefully. <p> The ministry's name is valued MPs, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, but it appears the <PARTY> has forgotten the young again in this budget. When you're called the Ministry of Youth and Sports, you're mainly only understanding the sports part, so all the speakers you're about to talk to are former athletes. But your sense of sports is just like your political logic: sport is equal to building just construction. Even those who approach sports with this rhubarb point of view can't solve the problems of young people! I want to remind you in action that I have 13 million young friends in Turkey right now, and that is 16 percent of our population. Did you know that a million and a hundred thousand of these young people are college graduates and unemployed? And the youth unemployment is now 21 per cent; the unemployment rate of our young women is 26.5 per cent. So, bottom line, the young unemployed army is concerned about their future, valued surrogates. <p> In today's world, there is another very important concept about young people: neither in education nor in employment. Have you ever heard of this concept, precious Regents? So in our country right now, 28 percent of our young people are neither trained nor employed, and our young people are between 15 and 29 years old. And with that figure, you have unfortunately brought Turkey to the 1st place among the OECD countries. I congratulate you from here. <p> Well, we're the youngest population in Europe. Let's see if you can make the necessary opportunities for the young ones you brag about. Again, the investigation of OECD (OECD) has been conducted on 15-year-olds, the Life Pleasure Survey, the 15-year-olds, and in this order, our country is once again the most valuable surrogates of unhappiness. Once again, I applaud you from here. Our 15-year-olds, born and raised during the <PARTY>, are unhappy. I don't suppose you'll be billing us for this, either. <p> The other thing is, of course, you do college like you do housing. We did the most colleges in the world in ten years. We've done 99 colleges. You're bragging about it. And then what happens? As I've just stated, you're opening universities, graduating students, leaving our young people out of work. And then what happens? Brain drain. Look, 63% of my educated friends who emigrated from our country in 2017 have reached 63 per cent, and 40 per cent of my friends are young 20-34 years old. Just looking at these data, I don't think you understand the real problems of young people, and I don't think you want to see it or hear it. <p> When I look at your budget, I don't see any approach to solving young people's problems. Why? Because it is not by the needs of young people that we, the <PARTY>, understand that the building is being raised under the name of youth centers, not by the support of contractors. Thus, in our view, the actual name of the ministry is the appointed Ministry of Youth and Construction. <p> Let me tell you a little bit about us young people from the 21st century; you can ask your children when you go home, I'm sure they agree with me. We love our freedoms, we wonder and never stop questioning, we love humor, we believe in justice, we defend democracy. We are ambassadors of love and peace, not plaintiffs of hatred, as the President said. <p> May I have a moment, Mr. President? <p> And for all these reasons, we say no to the budget of a government that prevents our freedoms, can't even tolerate our humor, can't even be fair to us, not to mention the one and only leader of our republic, Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who ignores our only and true leader, the youth of the Great Leader, and I welcome all the young people who are used to pepper spray from here, who are delighted to stand in front of TOMAH. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a commitment to the Turkish nation's esteemed MPs for the motion we made regarding Article 45. I salute your high council. <p> At the beginning of my words, I ask the Great Creator to bring beauty to the Turkish Islamic world of 2014, where we are living the second day. I hope that in 2013, the massacres, tears and suffering of the Turkish nation that continued its presence in the Geography from East Turkistan to West Thrace, from the Caucasus to the Middle East, and from the Caucasus to the Middle East, will not be seen in 2014, while the Turkish nation will preserve its unity, its integrity, despite all the attacks and betrayals. <p> Mr. President, the honorable lawmakers, I'd like to share one matter with you. Recently, Vice President of the <PARTY>, former Parliament Speaker Mehmet Ali Şahin in a statement stating that a case being seen in the Supreme Court when he was Minister of Justice was being examined and sent to Pennsylvania, Fethullah Gülen. <p> If this is true, it means that the decisions made by all judicial authorities, particularly the Supreme Court, have been examined in such a way and determined by the outcome of extrajudicial mechanisms, which means that all judicial decisions, particularly the high judiciary, are questionable. When judges, prosecutors spend their time in negotiations, their decisions, their efforts to justify the reasons they've been writing all morning have been wasted. In order to eliminate this suspicion, the government must share with the public the name and file mentioned by the Minister of Justice or Mr. Mehmet Ali Şahin, while the Minister of Justice has to explain to us and to the public why he did not do what he did or failed to do. If that is not true, Mehmet Ali Şahin Bey must abandon all political adjectives and duties and apologize to the Turkish nation for this unrealistic statement, if he has brought such a thing to light or distract the government's hand. <p> Mr. President, honorable lawmakers, with the change we'd like to make, we'd like to ensure that the approval of the ethics committee of the hospitals involved in the detection of health institutions and institutions that will participate in scientific studies can also be approved. Thus, in the process of not including other health institutions and institutions for clinical research in some centers and hospitals, the ethical board, as well as the board, aims to maintain the control of the scientific work of these boards. <p> In order for this arrangement to be healthier, I hope and ask your grand delegation to approve this motion. <p> On the other hand, if you want to be considered the basic duties of a state, the concepts that come to mind immediately are ▪ safety, education, health, and justice. The bill we're negotiating today is a bill that makes significant changes in health care, one of the main tasks of the state. <p> We're going through a period in which the government has expressed a lot of talks about transformation in health. It should be considered that there really has been a transformation, but we also need to address some of the findings of this transformation. First, a transformation in health should be highlighted in the 57th government, where radical change moves have been discussed. Today, social security is the only roof over social security, the idea and legal infrastructure for the merger of health care institutions under one roof, the use of the desired pharmacies is the work of the 57th government that talks, argues, projects. The protocol for the use of everyone under the umbrella of social security from private health services was signed during the 57th government period and was then signed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Ministry of Health. I'd like to bring this to your memory. Today, it is common for <PARTY> governments, who have completed their 11th year, to ignore what was done before it, to deny it. This is nothing but disloyalty. Just as in 2009, the financial system-based crisis in the world had less impact on Turkey, as it was denied by <PARTY> governments that the banking system had been disciplined by the 57th government; just as the Marmaray Project was designed, projected, signed, made up of financial agreements, made up of the groundbreaking process of hiding from the public. <p> With these thoughts, I wish the bill to be a blessing, I ask for the acceptance of our motion, and I greet the Turkish nation's MPs with respect.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a commitment to the 556th and Higher Education Act and to amendments to the Constitution of some Laws and Laws. I salute you all. <p> Now, dear friends, there's no doubt that education is at the top of the areas where political governments work the most, turning it into the most sabbatical board. Political powers constantly deal with education from primary school to university. But why do political powers deal with education? Because political powers that control the field of education try to raise a generation in line with their own ideology, their own perspectives or paradigms. <p> Well, the <PARTY> has been in power for 16 years and has changed 16 national education ministers, if I'm not mistaken. All ministers of the <PARTY> are coming from the same party, carrying the same paradigm, the same philosophy, but every minister is tearing apart all the arrangements for his predecessor's friend's education system, aside from a new system. He doesn't like the arrangements his own friend brought him. And then another Minister of National Education comes along, and he goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on Well, what does he need it for? Because the <PARTY>'s effort to turn its intended educational system into party training and turn universities into the party's academic state probably didn't reach the level they wanted. <p> So, what do you want to do today? There's three things he's done. <p> One: centralization of education, one-handed, one-minded, one-mention mindset, creating a central system. <p> Secondly, it's not an area of science and theory in general, it's an effort to transform education into a business firm, into a business establishment, not an area where research develops. <p> He has another goal, a third goal, which is to get political staffing in the field of education, especially in universities, even in secondary education. <p> And what is the result of that? As a result, certain results arise. What's one? At first, there's no such thing as academic freedom. <p> Second of all, there's no such thing as the autonomy of universities. Because science, real science, can only be produced in autonomous conditions, with ideological, political debates, can never really be produced. <p> So, what's the third? As a result, a third situation is being destroyed as a result of scientific development and scientific savings. <p> See, in this sense, the first intervention began after the September 12, 1980 military coup, when the junta formed an institution called the NGO, which is exactly what the junta was aiming for. Today in power, the <PARTY> thought of them as a guardianship institution when it came to power, said it would lift them, but what happened was, with four hands, it hugged these institutions, even made the YKK worse, even more ruthless than the practice of the junta regime. What's he aiming at? It's simple, to teach the university, to drink the teachers, students, staff, like the logic of the junta regime. What else does he want to do with it? To dominate his own ideology, and to remove all opposition academics, all students, even staff from the university. E, July 15th is a great opportunity after a coup attempt, and it's still going on. <p> So why are colleges divided by this bill? Well, you've got to see this, too. One is to open space for academics or academic candidates with their own allies. <p> What else does he want to do? On the eve of the election, I'm doing the 2nd university in your province, starting the third university...... by splitting up the university that exists in some provinces....... to distribute bribes, bribes through science. <p> What's the third? Hospitals, such as Chapa, such as Surgery, are in the heart of Istanbul, where under those names, you can move them to other places and create an amazing Rant area of support again. <p> Can I finish? <p> So, just as I've just given you in his own past, like every minister of national education has been able to put his previous friend's practices on the shelf, I assure you, if the <PARTY> had the time, if the election hadn't been early, if it had continued by 2019, there would have been no doubt a new minister of national education, Mr. National Minister of Education, who would have put this educational system on the shelf, but that opportunity is no longer available. On June 24th, I hope this educational system and the educational community will be rid of you and our people, and I salute you all.\n",

            "Text: Dear President, dear members of our House, I have taken a pledge to express the opinion of the EC PARTY group regarding the presidential election law, and I salute you all. <p> Dear friends, I'd like to remind you once again what we're discussing here. We're discussing the presidential election law. So why was this law set up, why did it come to us, to our agenda? A previous amendment in the Constitution states that the final joke of Article 102 is that the President's choice, the choice of the President, and the basis of the Constitution, can be arranged by law. So we are faced with a law prepared to fulfill the last joke of Article 102 of the Constitution. <p> Our friends talked. There's, of course, a lot of big talk going on here. Central Asian-type democracy, historical responsibilities, fascism -- probably one of the most common words of this era. - In the name of God. So, what are we doing? Since the Parliamentary system has changed, the Constitutional amendment has already changed with the amendment of the 101st and 102th amendments of the Constitution since 31 October 2007. Are we just realizing this? Are we realizing that the new President will be elected by the public? No, no, if you're not a fan of this, do you think that this law, this system, can be replaced? <p> In that sense, the debate here is actually general, always, everywhere, words that can be said. Details and legal information about the content of the law were not given here, nor were they given here. <p> Dear friends, now, look, there's talk of a political debate, a political project. Some of our friends have expressed it here, and the commission has spoken more clearly. Look, the debate over the President's term is not only held among politicians, but among academics there are such discussions. In this regard, we can't just assume that there's an argument between politicians in the routine of daily politics. There is a split between academics and constitutional jurisprudence. <p> Another friend said the arrangement for the election of the President by the public was a reactionary arrangement. It's a good idea to go into detail with a little reminder. <p> Friends, the election of the President by the public was discussed at various times in Turkey, but remained at a theoretical level of discussion. In the early 2000s, it was brought up again, but it was not realized. <p> The constitutional amendment to the election of the President by the public is related to the 367 decision of the Constitutional Court, which just emerged. You know, when the 10th President's term expires, the process of electing the President has been initiated according to the regulations of the Constitution, the 101st and 102nd Articles of the Constitution of 82. Parliament has taken action to elect the President, candidates have been appointed and held its first meeting, but then, you know, there's a statement published on the General Staff's website in those days, followed by the election process to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court made a decision based on the number of qualified meetings, not only in Turkey's history, but in the history of the world and an idea that is not in the constitutional literature. The number of qualified meetings is a concept that is not in literature. The Constitutional Court felt it was mandatory to find 367. For the election of the President to be held. This detail, I don't want to get into an argument, but with this decision, it has become clear that Parliament can't choose the President, or even choose the impossible. After that, Parliament has already decided to renew the elections and is going to the elections. If another system for the election of the President is not adopted, then there will be a new one, and the post-election Parliament will not be able to elect the President, so there is a chance that he will go to the election. With the Constitutional Court's comment on that, with the 367 comment, the possibility of parliament choosing the President had to be adopted a different way. It's not a reactionary arrangement, it's a practical necessity. In this regard, the Constitutional amendment adopted the election of the President by the public. It's not a reactionary arrangement, it's the first one. <p> Second: Dear friends, the election of the President by the public is also important in our history. The presidential elections have always been controversial in our political history. In particular, there are those who remember the debates that took place after the election of the first President of the 61 Constitution after May 27, 1960. The late Ordinaryus, Professor Ali Fuat, has been nominated for the presidency of the Prime Minister, and he has been personally dismissed, not only by the threat of death, but also by a new coup threat, by the threat of intervention, by resigning from the presidency, and his candidacy has been reduced from this regard. Look at the presidents who were elected after him. One of the main reasons for the coup on September 12, 1980 was that Parliament failed to elect the President. Then, our friends expressed it, and I agree with him: the Constitution, in particular, prepared the presidency for the Kenan Universe, in accordance with the legislation prepared after the September 12, 1980 conflict, but the presidency prepared it because it thought that the office was to be a part of the bureaucratic oligarchy. As a matter of fact, the head of state of the era in public talks of the Constitution said: The main problem of the previous Constitution is that it is weak to operate. We're strengthening the execution. But there are two wings in the parliamentary system: a government -- elected -- and the presidential office. We don't strengthen the elected government because they're politicians, they've already brought the country to September 12th. We are strengthening the presidency. Why? Because it's not about politics, it's not about being chosen, it's about coming through bureaucratic oligarchy, whether it's soldiers or civilians. This fiction was constructed to some extent by this paradigm late Ozal move, but then the paradigm continued to exist again. But when, in April 2007, the new President was able to elect the Parliament of the period and the majority of Parliament was able to determine the President, then the paradigm reached its point of collapse. So, all the elements of the status quo, of the establishment, and they wanted to make that choice impossible. Of course, the process of electing the President by the public, in addition to the practical necessity I mentioned, comes as this theoretical issue. <p> The election of the President by the public in Turkey is a very important step towards civilisation, the relocation of the democratic system, a huge gain. There's no way Turkey can go back from this. <p> Dear friends, it is assumed that after the Constitutional Court's decision, the 11th President will be elected by the public after the Constitutional Court's decision, when the Constitutional Court has decided that the President will not be elected by Parliament when the amendment is being made. But with the July 22, 2007 elections, our beloved nation has created such a parliamentary structure because of its direct state of politics, that this Parliament structure shows that the President will be elected by Parliament. <p> And I'm pleased to recall here the position of the National Movement Party, which I find correct, once again, in the commission. <p> He has elected the Parliamentary President, but after the constitutional amendment has been made -- I don't enter into details -- the situation of the constitutional amendment being put into a referendum. The referendum will be held on October 21st. Thus, the outcome of the referendum had to be revealed for the constitutional amendment to take effect, even though it had been passed through Parliament. Thus, the 11th President was elected according to pre-constitutional amendment provisions, elected by Parliament. About two months after the president's election, the new amendment came into effect as a result of the referendum. It's useful to remind us of this process because we're looking at the Constitution, the President's term of office in the Constitution has been five years, so why are we discussing it? The temporary clause brought in is contrary to the Constitution. They make some evaluations, such as these. Of course, that's what it's all about when you look at it in a wholesale sense, but it's not like that when you go into detail. The President was elected on August 28, 2007. The Constitutional amendment to the election of the President was adopted on October 31, 2007. So there is a point here where a rule of law is applied to an event that precedes it. I'll get into those details in a minute. I'm expressing why there's no temporary matter here. <p> Now, since the president's election of the 11th President was considered by the public, it was initially thought that there was no need for a transition clause in this regard because it was considered to be elected. <p> You'll understand, just a minute... <p> But after choosing the Parliamentary President, the interim 18th and 19th amendments that organised the 11th President's election had lost the ability to apply, so they were to be removed from the Constitutional text that went to the referendum.\n",

This further explained to us that Turkey, Burdur, and Burdur, are a first-degree earthquake zone. Why am I saying this? In particular, the state hospital in Burdur, my own constituency, serves in an inadequate building with a decree of destruction, proven by expert and scientific reports. This means that bedridden patients and treated patients are seriously at risk in a possible earthquake. I'm calling the Ministry of Health one more time, and I want an immediate solution to this situation. <p> Rights violations of human rights, the fourth judicial package at the end of the 19th year, when the party state was established instead of the legal state, almost all of the institutions of the state were defaced. It is not possible for all the negatives in the judiciary to be resolved and the changes brought with four packages to succeed without changing the mindset of governance. Because, for 19 years, your current mentality has been clear about human rights and freedom. The Law on the Constitutional Court's Constitutional Court's Establishment and Judiciary Code, which has been changed 24 times, is now being changed again in the Law on Administrative Judiciary Law, which has been changed 38 times, in the Turkish Penal Code, and in the Law on Penalty, which has been changed 44 times. However, in March, you announced the Human Rights Action Plan with the slogan \"Free individuals, strong society, more democratic Turkey.\" And you said: \"Man's honor, as the essence of all rights, is under the active protection of the law. The main purpose and duty of the state is to protect and improve these rights. <p> Your second statement: \"Everyone is equal to the law without discrimination on the basis of racial, racial, color, gender, political thought, philosophical belief and so on.\" But we all know that as long as this person is in this skin, Brother Brunson is free on one phone, Osman Kavala is still in prison for spite. <p> The fact that public services are offered equally, objectively and honestly to everyone is the main feature of all administrative activities. You said that, but in the pandemic process, you've put up all obstacles to prevent running <PARTY> municipalities, and you've even closed the soup kitchens. <p> What you understand about freedom of contract is that it's nothing more than the tenders you've given to the top five-tenths of a gang all over the world. <p> Again, you have made a great statement, \"Adli and administrative action; the purity of innocence takes a central approach that protects, strengthens, and protects the principles of personal responsibility.\" But when your president comes out to speak, he can declare 50 percent of this country a terrorist on purpose because of his thoughts. <p> No one can be deprived of their freedom due to criticism or a statement of opinion by respecting other people's personal rights, but Turkey is the first in the international ranking of arrested journalists in last week's report. <p> Again, the state of law, protected by independent and impartial judgment, is under investigation in all areas as guarantees of rights and freedoms and of justice, you said. In the rule of law, however, Turkey ranked number 107, among 128 countries, and you agreed to it. <p> You have agreed to the London courts as an authority in the discrepancies of the public-private agreements. For us in a sovereign land, it was an extremely humiliating signature. <p> The final words again are: The judgment cannot be corrected by the unchanging packages of the mind. <p> Let me say hello, Mr. President. <p> In an early or early election, we will bring justice to all Turkey under the leadership of Mr. President Kemal Kilicdaroglu, and all Turkey will meet in peace. <p> I pay my respects.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, my fellow congressmen, I salute you with love. <p> First of all, winter is coming, winter is at the door, and believe me, our citizens are wondering how we're going to get through this winter. Everything came at the cost of fire, and we're already in a pandemic process, and it's still going on, but you know what you said now that we've started the normalization process. Our people are in real trouble. So, as Mr. President told you, I suggest you go down to the streets, go down to the markets, go down to the markets and listen to the people there. Our citizen is in real trouble. <p> See, now, at the beginning of this year -- just at the beginning of this year -- three years, not five years ago -- the shade of coal was 1,200 liras, now 1,400 liras: from this year's beginning to this year, the wood was $600, now 800 liras. So a citizen has to put $2,200 in his pocket so he can pay for it. Now the question is, when the minimum wager gives them to you, you have 124 lira left in your pocket. For God's sake, put your hands on your conscience, what will our minimum-paying citizen do after paying for them? What's the pensioner gonna do, our needy pensioner? He's going to put all his salary in wood, coal. <p> Now, let's see what the picture looks like in electricity and natural gas. Look, here's the painting, the natural gas and electricity of a family of four. Here, in 2017, it paid 140 liras for natural gas, and now it's up to 250 liras; up from 140 liras to 250 liras, 80 per cent. Electricity went from 101 to 172 lira, increase 70 percent. The question here is, which officer, which worker, which employee has increased so much that they can afford it? And on top of that, you're making fun of people, and you're saying, \"Well, sir, according to TÜİK, that's inflation, that's... When you walk around the market, go into an aunt's arm, go ask. Aunty, the power says 11% of inflation. Where do they live? That's why we say it's good for everyone to be in the market because you listen to people's troubles. <p> At the same time, imagine a power that has been in power for years, that he and his ruling partner are campaigning for Hangover Bread. Well, the Hangda Bread Campaign, but here's the confession of that, at the end of the 18-year-old government's failure to govern, inept policies, our nation is on the hook. You know what that means? Unfortunately, in the next election, our citizen, who we need for this hanging bread, will teach you such a lesson that you will see that you will fight, let alone power in the upcoming elections, even to stand against the opposition. <p> Now, we've prepared a law proposal. With this bill, we're contributing 155 lira to those in need, 155 liras. Our citizens are watching everyone. All my fellow lawmakers who put their hands on your conscience, with your 155 lira support here, both our pensioner and our borrower will have seen a warm state's hand in this winter, while in this black winter and in the dark, he will have felt the compassion of the state. If you all raise your hands together here, support this offer, we'll bring it up and comfort our citizens. <p> I don't think anyone here is going to say no, but I am speaking to my friends who love their homeland and their nation. <p> Besides, friends, the Republic of Turkey can't be ruled. Look, the dollar's already past $8, euro's running 10 lira, unemployment is breaking records, there's a hidden unemployment, we're facing an economic crisis, but the Minister of the country says: for God's sake, Mr. Secretary, get out of the palace, go to the street, see if there's a crisis in the palace, there's a crisis in the country. <p> Look, dear friends, you say good news, good news, and good news, we have an offer for you: now give this good news to our citizens. How do you project it? When you will come out, you will say, \"We gave you good news in the gas, and we gave you good news in it, and we gave you good news in it. <p> If you'll excuse me. <p> We'll have all the good news for our country, for our nation, but let's have some of that good news for the citizens. Our deals on the sale are pending right now. I just told you, black winter's at the door, we need to touch this citizen. This many MPs here are here with our nation's votes. We're here to hand over their rights, their law, and their justice. Our proposal is to sit at the table with Russia as soon as possible, put these contracts ahead of schedule and negotiate the price. Download the VAT to 1 percent of electricity and natural gas, remove the OTV, remove the TRT portion of electricity, transparency the bills, activate the energy co-ops and open them up. In our country, in energy, I'm afraid you've left our people out of control. In your energy policies, you see 83 million of our citizens as customers, and you're putting all the weight on this nation. So I say, let's put this on the agenda, and let's be a salve to people's wounds. <p> Thank you all.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, on behalf of the <PARTY>, I salute you all. <p> I pray that the moon of mercy and blessings, Ramadan, will bring beauty to our country. <p> Dear friends, this bill we're discussing is made up of 38 articles, a bag of laws, as it is a habit, and a separate subject is held in each article, and it seems to be filled in a particular bag of disorganized issues. If you say, \"What's in it?,\" as the poet puts it, \"whatever you're looking for is no more than a cure for trouble.\" So there's no radical solution, there's no major solution to the country's main problems; there's palliative little arrangements. Of course, we have votes in these materials, which we don't think are true, but there's a lot of stuff that isn't a problem-resolved, but it's just to keep the public busy. In that sense, indeed, the main issue is a painting that shows that power has no ability to address the fundamental problems of the country, rather than waste time, when such an offer, which is close to 40, has come here. <p> What are the most fundamental problems in the country? Look, wherever you go to the corner of the country -- you can go to the tank, go to the garden if you want -- the picture is clear; the country is on fire, the kitchens are on fire, and there's nothing in these 40 items that can cure price increases. No inflation, as if the government had forgotten inflation. However, the number of March inflation has been announced, as you know, TÜFE is 61 per cent according to TÜİK's figures, and 143 per cent according to ENAG. There's a terrible difference, but one reflects the market, and one is similar to the numbers the government uses to correct power. In TÜFE, there is an inflation of 115 per cent, even according to TİK's figures, dear friends, at 115 per cent inflation producer prices. This is a terrible painting, one of the highest inflations in Turkey's history. This means that it's official that everyone in this country is miserable until they get from manufacturer to consumer, but most importantly, between the UFE and TÜFE, the difference between wholesale prices and consumer prices has risen to 59 percent. Such a big difference also states how difficult the tradesman has become under this inflation clamp. Normally, when we say inflation, we talk about the problems of the people living in this country, but the difference between the UFE and TÜFE clearly shows that the tradeshop is creating a tradesman who can't put the goods back on his shelf at the price he sells. In that sense, no matter where you look, as long as there's this inflation fire back home, nothing's good. We're looking at the last few months, especially in the last four months, even according to TÜİK, where inflation has endured three hundred percent, dear friends. November 2021, 21 per cent inflation; December 2021, 36 per cent inflation; January 2022, 48 per cent; February 54 per cent, March 61 per cent. So inflation has increased 3 times from that period when the government, with all due respect, lectured the economy in Turkey. What policy could be more awkward than that? Oh, sir, the government, who is trying to take refuge in a constant excuse like external conditions, internal conditions... unfortunately, it never accepts its own responsibility. However, if the economy is broken in this country, which is corrupt, if economic policies are wrong, which is wrong, there is a number-one responsibility, which is the government implementing these policies. The government's search for another responsible person is futile and pointless, but you see, in August, when inflation was 19 per cent last August, the president said clearly and clearly: ▪ Inflation will no longer go higher, because we reduce interest rates, and then inflation will fall. The Treasury and Finance Minister said that the economy will improve within three or five months. But the Central Bank announced that in December, at the end of 2022 years, inflation would be 23 percent. <p> Dear friends, the Central Bank shows 23 per cent of inflation 12 months from now, but today, as of March inflation, three months of inflation has risen to 23 per cent. So, you see, the head of government can't see how the country is going to be run well, he can't choose, there's a discrepancy in what he's saying; you see, the Treasury and Finance Minister is saying inconsistencies, and what they say doesn't happen, but what's the worst of it is that the Central Bank predictions are so surprised. So there's no such thing as the Federal Reserve. Why? It's the government that brings out all these paintings, it's power; let's remember, the government said: I'm going to reduce the policy interest. All economic problems in Turkey will be resolved. The Kur will rise a bit, the current will close open, we'll give more, and after a moderate period, indicators of inflation, unemployment will fall. (All economists in Turkey, academics in Turkey have dismissed. You've already sunk the economy, you've already spent the economy, the Federal Reserve, the reserve money, the shroud money, you've spent 128 billion dollars of the Central Bank, you haven't left any money in the Central Bank, the reserves are down; they're running between 50 or 40 billion dollars. If you reduce policy interest in these conditions, it destroys the economy, destroys the citizen, turns the country into a fire; give up this job. After a while, the economists again cried out, \"Oh, don't do it. This government has dropped a hundred base points again; again, the courtship has risen, inflation has risen. Another time passed, and the government said, \"We're going to lower it again.\" He said, \"We're going to reduce policy interest by 200 base points; and again, the currency and inflation exploded.\" After him, again, for the fourth time, when he announced that he would reduce policy interest, all of Turkey cried out: economists, academics, citizens, politicians sharing, saying that this is wrong, the consequences of your work appear. Oh, don't do that this time. Even though the government said, \"Don't do that.\" The government dropped the policy interest by another 100 base points, and the court jumped horribly. You said, \"Don't lower this policy interest.\" You said, \"The court has risen because of it.\" The government has filed criminal charges against academics and citizens in many economies in Turkey. What kind of logic is that? What are we getting at now? What we're getting at is, unfortunately, a disaster, everything's turned into a fire, prices are terrible, nothing can be bought, nothing can be touched. For example, what do we see if we quickly review the price hikes and raises that come to some goods? Sugar is 320 percent, engine is 260 percent, gas is 250 percent, autogas is 230 percent, sunflower oil is up 210 percent, dear friends. 70 percent to electricity, 150 percent to the kitchen tube, 150 percent to the bread, 140 percent to the flour, 130 percent to the meat, milk, 110 percent to the transport, dear friends. Pepper -- Nisana -- came up to 40 liras when it was 16 liras, 150 percent increase; eggplant went up to 25 liras when it was 8 liras; a 25 percent increase when the tomato was 5 liras; a 25 percent increase when the potato was 500 percent; a 200 percent increase when it was 4 liras; a 15 percent increase when the pumpkin was 5 liras; an orange raise at 100 percent; a broccoli at 240 percent; a 25 percent increase when the cucumber was 5 liras; a 500 percent increase when the tomato was 5 dollars; a raise at 500 percent. Where in the world are these raises? Not anywhere, dear friends. Look, compare the eurozone with Turkey; 7.5 per cent in the TÜFE euro region, 61 per cent in Turkey. Sir, there's inflation outside, and there's a raise outside, so why don't you see the raises outside? Their condition is worse than ours. The ruling members are directly trying to deceive the citizen, straight to the truth. Could 7.5% inflation be the same as 61 percent inflation? Inflation in Europe is 7.5 percent. Prices in Turkey, especially food prices, are always doubling. Look, one of the seven highest inflation countries in the world is Turkey, all over the world. While you're in this situation, you're still doing good, and you're making speeches, and you're saying, \"We're in good shape, Europe, America is in bad shape.\" I'll give you another number: Turkey is the 1st in Europe and Turkey is the second in Europe to increase electricity prices. I thought they were worse off than us. <p> Yes, dear friends, unfortunately in Turkey, because of this fire, 27 million people on welfare are miserable, 13 million pensioners are miserable, 5 million officers are miserable, 17.5 million students are miserable because of the government's policy of raising power, and unfortunately millions of farmers have fallen victim to this government. <p> Yes, this government, which is not looking for a serious, serious solution to the main issues of economics, has also neglected the fundamental issues of this law proposal, which require radical solutions, but is also busy keeping the public busy by playing small games in certain articles. <p> We can take the 34th article concerning the victims of my home as an example. Look, on July 1st, 2021, the BDDK decided that a total of 21 savings would be terminated by the financing company. Along with this liquidation, a group of our citizens, called the victims of my home, have stated that the number of bureaucrats involved in the commission is 47,000 -- they have suffered, they have been devastated. The hopes of having a home and a car are shattered by our citizens who have invested every last penny in their pockets to get a car. After the BDK's decision to liquidate, after nearly nine months, the law proposes that the Parliament organise the issue and pay the citizens their money. But it doesn't solve any problems, this package, this offer doesn't solve any problems. The problems of the victims of my home are getting deeper and deeper, and they are bound by the law, by the law. So this matter needs to be reconsidered, dear friends, until it comes to Article 34, it is useful to establish inter-party inter-party cooperation and re-organise the matter. Otherwise, unfortunately, the loss of rights, the loss of rights of the victims of my house will continue to be deepened. <p> There's been a lot of discussion at the Plan and Budget Commission, because of the substance related to the victims of my house. After these discussions, two arrangements were made, with the approval of the ruling parties, two small arrangements. This is a positive step, but it is not capable of removing the problem and the loss of rights. It was unclear when they would receive their money, and a statement was placed that the victims would be paid within a month. Second, the Commission's text envisioned a prison sentence of one to three years for news and sharing that discredited the companies. It's really irrational, and your offer was a violation of your soul, it was a clause, it's been removed from the Commission. Two positive steps have been taken, but that's never enough, dear friends. <p> The money the citizens pay is made up of two parts. First of all, the cost of organization is referred to as ▪ or the price of service. The second is the citizens' savings payments. What does the 34th article say? It says: \"We will return your payment to you as much as you have paid, but the cost of the organization will not be returned. There is a great injustice here, and there is a great injustice.\" Look, I've looked into it, and there are so many victims who have paid the price of $63,000 in organization, even though the money they're saving is $7,000. Now you're telling this citizen that I'm not going to pay the $63,000 organization you're paying, and according to this law, I'm going to give you $7,000, and you're going to shut up, and you're going to consider yourself entitled. It's not going to be fixed, dear friends. And you're legally deleting it. <p> Secondly, I'd like to offer the clients... <p> Did I use the extension? <p> Okay.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, lawmakers, one of the most important agendas today is the cover-up of the corruption operation that began in December 17th. Dear friends, there was no, there was no, there was no, there was no, it was a fake plan. Hundreds of articles have been published, hundreds of articles, comments, television programs have been made, but in the end, there has been no clear, clear, apocalyptic outcome. I don't want to go into these details, so what's written, what's drawn? What's done? Who said that? But what we come up with in the greatest allegations of corruption in the history of the republic is just a big public dissatisfaction. I repeat: there was, there wasn't. (It was true, it was wrong.) The most important thing that came beyond their claims may have been closed in this file form, but when, at any given date, Turkey will open these files again one day. <p> Of course, if there was nothing, why did the four ministers resign? So, first of all, these four ministers, if they're actually cleared, they need to be reinstated, even if it's just for a day. Second: A minister who resigned on the same day, Mr. Erdoğan Bayraktar, appeared before the televisions. We -- in my opinion, we did nothing wrong, but whatever we did -- we did it under his direction -- by naming the name of Mr. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at that time. <p> Now, dear friends, in a democratic state, and in a state of 80 million people, there are over 1 million, 2 million, 3 million tribal states in the world, and there are states ruled by phony democracies -- and in a state that claims to be an example in its region, to be a leader, you can't simply pass those claims. Phone calls that mention the existence of $1 billion, and the descriptions of a so-called businessman involved in the same work can't be so simple. No one in this parliamentary platform or in Turkey has made a incriminating statement concerning Mr. Mehmet Simsek and Ali Babacan, who are most involved in these financial relations, so to speak, holds the state's vault. Why wasn't he found? In the so-called business statement published in these operations again, the so-called \"tapes,\" these men are very strange men, and we couldn't penetrate them, he said. <p> So, dear friends, before you go and go about it so much, before you talk too much about it, and then the first and last thing I want to say: Dear friends, let's put all this stuff aside, let alone the truth, the falsehood, and if you love your God, what business do you have with this child? What are you doing with these in the VIPs? What are you doing sitting next to them in government protocol? So if you look at yourself and ask yourself, what are you doing with these people if you love God, based on the adjectives you carry, as statesmen, and the importance of the positions you sit in? They ask the person, they say, \"Tell me who your friend is. \" The people you're traveling with, the people you're sitting with, the people you're eating with, the people you're joking with, look around if it's not consistent with the weight of where you're standing, especially if it's so dark, if it's so dark, you have to sit next to them for miles. <p> So, my dear friends, once again, nothing has been cleared, nothing has been closed, nothing has convinced the conscience of the public, nothing has. These files will be reopened at any time, review what you've done with your consciousness and account. <p> Dear friends, I have addressed you again and again from this bench, and brought to the attention that the construction changes in Istanbul, the screaming of an entire Istanbul, have been looted. Believe me, there haven't been so many raids in Istanbul since Byzantine. As a brother who lived in Istanbul since he was a child and lived for twenty-five years, and spent all summer vacations in Istanbul and Boğaziçi, my heart is burning, I feel like an Istanbulian. And I asked for something very simple in the Parliament's research proposal for these actions in Istanbul, and I said, \"Who are the first owners of the plots, the islands, the faftas, since 1994, under your responsibility? So, please explain to me who are the owners of these zoning changes before they were made, and who are the owners after the zoning changes were made. <p> And again, we're doing something very right, and there's no corruption in them, and we've done all these changes according to a certain rule. If you say so, then how much is the rate that's going on around here? I mean, what's the value before the development change, what's the value after the zoning change? That's what I asked. <p> Three: I said, \"Friends, if you're so sure of what you're doing, \"then let's put a zoning change into a zoning tax.\" I also offered a law on this. Let a commission be set up, and what is the value of that parcel before the change in development, and what is its value next; and let 20 per cent of the rate of that amount enter into the treasury of the state. <p> You objected to what I said, and I'm speaking to the lawmakers here, and I'm speaking to a few friends who are listening to me -- you raised your hands and said no. But today Mr. Ali Babacan came in front of the cameras, and he's been talking about this rent tax for two months. But when does he mention it? After all of Istanbul was sold. <p> Have you ever been to Esenyurt, dear friends? Have you ever seen such a disgrace? Have you seen what happened out there? But we turned around, and two years after I proposed this law again, Mr. Ali Babacan, Mr. Mehmet Simsek has come to talk about this debt. <p> My dear friends, again, I confronted the businessman who cursed the mother of the nation at these events in the VIP hall recently, and I ran into him, and he was on a pilgrimage -- of course, how he got into the VIP, and he was with the <PARTY> MPs who had gone on a separate pilgrimage. He said: \"You speak too much against us.\" No, you give this account. I said one. Two: \"You are a businessman, you are a 35-year-old engineer -- says so, I am a business figure.\" You say, \"I got all of this right.\" I spoke to Mr. Buli Yıldırım, who is the Minister of Transport from the Parliament's platform; this is Hasankeyf Bridge 1,090 meters; the first Bosporus Bridge is 1,070 meters, taller than the Bosporus Bridge. Give it half price, and the Diyarbakır businessmen also met all these technical and financial conditions, and I called it a suitor. I said, \"Well, he didn't give a satisfactory answer.\" You know what he said to me when he came back? Of course, one of those bridges is $130 million. Is this a job for me? I'm already doing this to your satisfaction. Don't get tired, don't enjoy it. Come on, look, there are businessmen who can do this for half the price. <p> Here, dear friends, look who you're walking with, who you're on pilgrimage with, who you're dealing with. Therefore, I address the MPs within the <PARTY>, and I address the friends with a conscience: If you do not say these things today, stop. If you do not raise your voice, believe me, you will suffer a great deal in the conscience that remains tomorrow. <p> My respects.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, dear MPs, you're really tired, thank you very much for your efforts on behalf of our pensioners. <p> We're making an important law. Under the responsibility of being a state, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, in order to hand over a right to be the nation's legislature, we spent about ten hours of overtime together, and here we came up with a law that would meet the expectations of nearly 2 million of our people. I wish you all the best, but I would like to hereby present to you some truth, or to me, from the truth, to your appreciation, to your discretion. <p> Dear friends, I repeat, justice is the foundation of property. Sovereignty belongs to the nation, but there is a obligation to be just in order to ensure that the state, which is the embodiment of this sovereignty, can be permanent. So you have to write on the opposite wall that justice is the foundation of property for every member of parliament to read here. <p> We're trying to eliminate an injustice today. The state, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, has made its own rules, has wronged the citizens by its rule; has changed status, has altered history, has changed order, has done the same work, has created differences among people who serve at the same time. Now, we're correcting part of this, but there's a fact: justice is an ash, a whole, a whole. It means that if he does not correct one thing, correct the injustice of one, or correct the injustice of the same society, which is about public employees, employees of the government, or those who make a living by using their hard work, the rule maker, correcting one injustice, does not provide justice, he enlarges injustice. <p> Now, of course, Mr. Minister's efforts, his sensitivity are appreciated, and I'm not saying anything, but in this regard, there are statements from the former Minister. Look, he says: \"Is there no injustice among retired people? Isn't there injustice between workers and farmers, farm pensioners? Is there no injustice among the members of the retired Ark? Can we say that we've corrected all of this? <p> There is another truth, dear friends. You've been running Turkey alone for ten years on behalf of the Turkish nation, you have no excuse. If these injustices were a fact, it was your responsibility to correct it so far. After nine years, you have no right to come here and say, \"Here's what we're fixing.\" It doesn't satisfy anyone, and with the correction you've made, you're not actually ending injustice, you're deepening it. <p> So now I'm asking from here again. A friend of ours -- where is Mr. Kaçir -- says you talk a lot. But look, we talked in the morning, he invited the commission today, the subcommittee. There should be a law on civil servants, civil servants, which has been put on hold at the subcommittee for a 2012 raise on pensions. You, as a government, are doing the necessary raises just after the anniversary, you have the right, and you have the power, but why don't you give your officer his dues, why don't you give him a pay raise? You need the law to do that. The law comes here, but you keep it on the subcommittee. <p> We spoke this morning, and I just found out that the Commissioner invited the subcommittee to a meeting. <p> Well, I'm going to say this again, and I'm going to say this by example: so much injustice in the government's personnel system. Without fixing this, there is no way that we can maintain inner peace, peace of work, the will to live together. Come on, fix this. What's the catch? We'll finish your bonus. We'll call it. But unfortunately, at this point, it's always postponed by developing an excuse. <p> Now, Mr. Secretary says we didn't do populism. Is that so, Minister? <p> How are we going to evaluate the words of our Deputy Prime Minister? That's how he ended up in all the agencies. Mr. Bkent Arinc argued at the Council of Ministers, offered 50%, then our Minister of Labor, 60 per cent, then 70 per cent of understanding. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Treasury have also given a positive opinion, saying we will increase pension by 70 per cent. <p> Mr. Secretary, is this the law of a raise? Is that a raise law, for God's sake?\n",

            "Text: Thank you, Mr. President. <p> Dear lawmakers, I have made a pledge on behalf of the <PARTY> group on Article 24 of the Law Bill 548, with respect to the High Assembly. <p> As you know, we're facing a new bag of legislation. In addition to the 24th article here, the procedure and the basis for the fees paid by visitors to the entrance control centers or visiting centres within the fields are determined by the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs. Those who don't pay the entry fee are also referred to as... ten times the amount of fine. As for those who did not pay the fine within a month, the tax office concerned is authorized to follow and collect according to the Law on the Collectives of Amme Area 6183. Another article of the Law on the Collectives of Amme Acquisitions 6183 -- scarier -- requires evidence of bankruptcy and bankruptcy to get rid of these sentences. It's almost the death penalty. <p> If the areas rented from national parks are to be paid, that money must be earned first, so it must be invested in. What the ministry needs to do is do the comprehensive, environmental-friendly project by the Ministry, then take the tender for production, then check it out by the National Parks, and then complete the construction process, or rather, become the facility. <p> Prices should be reasonable, too. Otherwise, there will be areas where you use concrete and cover it with bark, use metal, paint it with wood color, where toilets flow with septic instead of cleaning. <p> During my own mayoral term, the Samsun Bayraktepe Nature Park area, one of which I have lived in the national parks, and the other one is the first-degree site of Samsun Tekeköy Caves, which is larger than the nature park. In my profession as an architect, considering the social classes as a village child, I have not served from here, in my time as an architect, nor from the entrance of the WC, nor from the mosque, nor from the social facilities, because these areas are usually, the most -- the low economic picnics are flocking -- economically, with low income levels. You find 100 people in these areas, where at least a thousand people come every day, especially when the weather gets better with the spring. Why do you find 100 people? Because he didn't consider the poorness of the law and the income of the citizens, and the customers of these areas are poor; they're not the ones who count for £1, £1 million, which is 15 million, like the heads of the royal family. According to <PARTY>'s capitalist view, this could be normal. The customers of these areas are usually people who calculate the end of the month, who come here with TOFAS, with Renault. <p> The fee for Samsun Bayltepe Nature Park was zero in my time, while it was painful with the <PARTY>. Subject is $3, bicycle is $3, motorcycle is $6, motorcycle is $9, car is $27, van is 45, bus is 72 lira, WC 1 lira; restaurant is already burning hands, stake brand. I asked for the price list to talk about it, and they said: \"The price list has changed.\" I called that friend: \"What is it?\" The dollar's up. Talk about a raise. Subject 3.5; motorcycle 7 lira, car 11 lira, van 32 lira, midibus 52 lira, bus 84 lira; let's pray here. Turkey averages 7 liras for individuals, 2,250 lira for weddings, which means the bride and groom will be separated by 10 times as many. <p> Now, based on the <PARTY> mentality, we ask: \"Aunt Fatma, Uncle Hasan, where are you going?\" (No, you're going to lie at the bottom of the tree, you're going to be shaded, you're free; you don't eat, you don't eat, you don't. Go to the bathroom, relax, it's free; it's not free. What's going to happen? Pray you, we don't get paid to watch the sky. Especially when you want to get paid for 2019. Let's get this king, and then you'll pay for the water, the bird's voice, all of it. If you don't have money from the citizen, you'll see it in the paintings of the king. When I look at the average of all time, we still pray. <p> The election was lifted from 2019, and your partner averaged August, possibly September. <p> Give up these fees at once, otherwise your last chance, your execution will come to pass. <p> Thank you, and I'll pay my respects.\n",

            "Text: Thank you, Mayor. <p> Dear friends, while the municipalities are stripped to death by trustees, there's beauty here. And I'll tell you the facts as Amed MP: since 2016, we've talked about a lot of trustees' corruption and irregularities, but things are so out of control that we hear and see new scandals every day. <p> In Amed, trustee municipalities are testing for personnel to rise in office, but leave this test for the last day, posting it on the clipboard for a few hours. However, the applications seem to only be from members of the BEM-BIRD-SEN, who have made special exams to this union. In this way, even though nearly 500 others have earned the test, their rights are being revoked, while the trustee is being passed by a new irregularity. <p> Let's move on. Amed's trustee is announcing a license-plate tender. As for the tender, the Service Room is appealing to the court. Look, it's Diyarbakir 1. The Supreme Court concluded that the case is not in accordance with the law. The court decides to halt the execution on March 22nd; on March 23rd, the trustee makes the tender the very day after the verdict. Although the tenders are illegal, the Service Room says there is no need for service in the city, the tender was made for a runt. <p> Let me talk about another tender: the Kulp Autogar. In 2018, Kulp County Autogar was built for $1,950,000. From that date to today, the Kulp Autogar doesn't work. Why? Because there was no proper work done, and after the construction was done, there were dents and landslides on the floor. The Amed trustee, appointed in 2019, announced two separate tenders for the county bus station. The first is the move of Kulp County Autogamous to Silvan, and the second is a new bus contract to Kulp. <p> As irregularities continue, the trustee has spent nearly 150 million budgets on buying trees in the last three years. The Parks and Gardens Department budget for 2022 is close to 500 million and is already being exhausted. And the trees of Sakariah and Shekeleh are taken, and they stand, and the trees are set up, and they are re-acquired. Trees are brought to the public that have nothing to do with the city's climate. That's how they make up the case of the stolen, because no one can count the trees, and since the purchases are made from out of town, the bills can't be traced. There are also irregularities in tree purchases according to Article 3/A of the Public Contraction Act. <p> Right now, the municipalities are talking about blackmail and irregular appointment scandals. While legally appointed by trustees and trustees, we hear it's imported from the BIM market chain to the head of the apartment. <p> The corruption and irregularities of the trustees have destroyed the people's assets economically, but the existence, language, culture, history and memory of the Kurdish people that are wanted to plunder. For example, the Council for the Protection of Cultural Beings is destroying the Tourist Palace Hotel, which was built by Armenian architects in 1953, although it is registered. Although the boned meat lung restaurant, which was built several years ago by stealing the historical stones of Surah, is on the loose, and the Diyarbakır Council for the Protection of Cultural Assets has detected the illegal structure, it does not intervene. Do you know who owns the illegal structure? The nephew of the district director of Diyarbakır Foundations of the period is the head of the DİYANET-SEN Branch. <p> You're trying to shut down our institutions, such as women, language, culture, and build an ideologically new institutional model for Turkish-Islam synthesis. There is a bulletin board in the Great Mosque, and almost all of the city's native language is not available in Kurdish, but the name of the Kurdish enemy is given to the forests. That's what you're doing: ignoring, looting the existence and values of this people. But know that you will not be able to do any work until you have the approval of the Kurdish people, and you will not be able to defeat them, and those before you have tasted it, and those after you will taste it. <p> I send my regards, my love to all of our comrades, in the presence of our co-chairs Gultan Kışanak and Selçuk Spear, to all the people who follow us.\n",

            "Text: Now, Mr. President, there was one thing that I thought I'd mention today when the group's deputy presidents were in line, but I also gave it up so we wouldn't have a function of advertising by saying it in the House. But now, when the <PARTY> MP spoke on the stand, it was probably necessary to express it. <p> Now, especially the Greek presence in the Black Sea, where they were destroyed, about 1,500 Greeks in Turkey, as if they had been exposed to a systematic assimilation, a melting policy, a policy of destruction, and so on. <p> As we open the House today, many of our members of parliament face a number of issues, such as the significance of the 16th of May, the importance of this day, the beginning of the Turkish liberation struggle, the day of the torch burning, in this process, where, for example, a number of programmes, such as the remembrance of the Pontus genocide in Ankara, have been attempted to be applied to, as tried to cover it. On May 16th, when we have this kind of speech and we're going to go to Samsun and start the struggle for salvation, we strongly condemn the Turkish nation, the Republic of Turkey, our history, our history, and we never, never, ever accept it, with a sense that we've destroyed something there, as if we've assimilated it, as if we've committed genocide. <p> When it comes to people here, I want to say that they're the ones who did the real racism when they're accusing them of fascism, racism. We base our idea of nationalism on consciousness, and we describe the same culture as sharing the same feeling in satisfaction, in joy, as a nation. The definition of this nation does not include racial debates. An Armenian in this country is the proudest member of this nation, the Turkish nation, after he's become a man who grieves with our sadness and rejoices with our joy, and at this point we don't separate anyone. <p> In addition, it is necessary to express some other challenges by using a number of data to accuse the Turkish nation of things it has never done in its history. There is only one nation in Turkey, the name of that nation is the Turkish nation, and the foundation of our nation's emotion, our nation's understanding is what I just expressed. Because of Garo Paylan's request, Turkey, the Turkish nation or the Anatolian land will not be Greek land; Garo Paylan will not be the land of this country because it wants it. I want to underline that.\n",

What I'm saying is that you've stolen the will of the people, violated the law of the polls, the electoral law, removed those who didn't recognize the results and appointed the trustees. But you had to replace 20 of those trustees you appointed because the trustees you appointed, the trustees appointed by your Home Secretary, they did all sorts of things -- theft, corruption, bribery, intimidation, all sorts of things. Look at Mardin. Look at Diyarbakır. Cases have been filed. Cases have been filed against the principals. There are many cases, and these investigations are still under way. That's what I'm saying.

            "Text: Mr. President, honorable lawmakers, as part of the budget bill for 2019, I have made a pledge on behalf of the EC PARTI on the budget of the President of the State. I hereby salute our General Assembly, our beloved nation. <p> As a sequel to the conversation just now, I am speaking as the grandson of Jafar Efe, who served at the Battle of the Liberation in Balıkesir. <p> I've made a commitment to the court budget. The district was founded in 1868 by Sultan Abdulaziz as one of the main institutions of the long-standing Turkish state tradition and became a constitutional institution with the Constitution of 1924, with the Constitution of 1961 and 1982. Article 114 of the 1961 Constitution, Article 125 of the 1982 Constitution, stipulated that all actions and procedures of the administration should be subject to judicial supervision. It is an effective and important judicial organisation in the judicial audit of the administration, as well as being an advisory and decision-making body that assists the executive body according to Article 155 of the Constitution. In this sense, it is a key guarantee of the principle of separation of forces and of course democracy. In this way, administrative transactions and decisions are intended to be established on the basis of state seriousness and justice, free of pleasure and periodicity. <p> Today, the administrative duties of the State and judicial duties of the State are strictly separate. The administrative and tax courts, along with the administration and tax courts, run the administration's audit through the judiciary. <p> There has been a serious decline in the number of jobs that were brought to the State in 2016 by the admin system. The number of jobs that arrived in 2017 is reduced by 60 per cent compared to the previous year. The number of cases reached in 2016 reached 165,000 in 2017, reaching 145 thousand in 2017, and as of December 5, 2018, the number of 19,000 files made to be concentrated will reach the previous statistics in December. <p> The decrease in the number of files and the increase in the speed of file extraction has also been reflected in the number of troubled files. The number of troubled cases in 2016 was 268 000 in 2017, and the number was 176,000 in 2017, as of December 5, 2018; so we can safely say that the parliamentary system reform has reached its goal. Over the years, it has been estimated that the burden of heavy work on the State may be lifted, as well as its primary function as its goal to conclude the trial in a reasonable time. <p> A total of $148m,175 000 for Central Management Budget Act in 2019, and a total of $182m,3200.000 for the State Security Institution's state premium, 10 million,416 thousand for the revenue and service costs, 1 million,926 thousand for the current transfer costs, 3,15120,000 for the capital costs. In 2019, Central Management Budget Law Proposals increased by 33m,348 thousand liras compared to the previous year, up 22 per cent, largely due to the increase in employee costs and social security institution state premiums. <p> According to Law 6723, the number of apartments of the State has been reduced to 10 units in six years since 2016; it still serves as 14 apartments. <p> When we look at the staff who carried out their duties, there are 623 judicial members, including 131 occupational members, 22 prosecutors, 470 students, and 960 administrative staff. <p> It is also a priority to increase the number of judges and qualified administrative staff, to regulate the universally ethical principles of judicial and administrative personnel, to be informed, to develop awareness, to address the lack of physical and technical infrastructure, to ensure and activation of administrative judicial services that have been moved to the UYAP. <p> I think it's important that all Supreme Court decisions, including the Court, be purged of personal data and published with a rank number, provide effective social supervision. <p> I hereby salute your grand delegation, wishing the Court of State, its employees, and all of our great nation.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the National Party of Movements on behalf of the entire Law Proposal 268. I salute the General Assembly and the viewers who watch us at the beginning of their screens with love and respect. <p> Dear lawmakers, in order for each country to maintain its existence, it must have a strong and national defense. This need, of course, will require the establishment of a national defence-specific legal order. Because in order for the Armed Forces to carry out the task they are expected to do, they also need a disciplinary mechanism that will establish this situation fairly and quickly, as much discipline as it needs to be equipped with weapons, ammunition, services and infrastructure. <p> Today, authority from top to bottom is based on the principle of military discipline, absolute obedience, which includes obedience from the bottom up. In any community, discipline and absolute obedience are not as vital as it is in the Armed Forces. After the Constitution of 1982 in particular, Turkey's military courts and positions of office have been discussed for many years. The focus of the debate was the broadness of the military courts' mandates, which would not be accepted in a democratic legal state, under the Article 148, of the Constitution of 1982. <p> On the other hand, it was seen that the authority to judge non-military courts was widely defined, that they did not have the concept of military crime, and that military judges did not have sufficient assurances of judgment. <p> The existence of first-level military courts for our Turkish Armed Forces, which are currently among the number-one armies of the world, and the existence of prosecutors and military high judicial bodies was concluded by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, which was legalized in 2017. With this constitutional arrangement, our country has been removed from the countries with special military courts and prosecutors, compared to the classification of judicial practices against the Armed Forces. Instead, the arrangement by the Judges and Prosecutors' Council included a model that specializes in military expertisation within civilian judicial systems such as the Dutch, Hungary, France samples. HSK 1. The files of the military courts whose office was removed on May 31, 2017 and 831 have been decided on the basis of the verdict, in the areas where there are 1 serious criminal court for crimes entering the field of heavy criminal courts, and in the places where there are more than one Heavy Penal Court, the Court of Criminal Court 1 has been taken care of. In terms of crimes involving the main criminal courts in the field of duty, it has been decided that in areas where there are 2 or less criminal courts, the main criminal court number 1 will take charge of these cases, and in places where there are more than two main criminal courts. <p> Dear lawmakers, it is possible for the state, citizens and society to be kept in safety, provided that our national security is ensured. For that, our Armed Forces must have a deterrent, powerful, and disciplined structure. As in our country, the discipline of the armed forces in the world is often attempted by the implementation of military penal code, including the crimes and penalties of military service. As the world's examples show, undisciplined armies are doomed to perish, states that fail to ensure their safety and survival are doomed to the same fate. For one country, it is therefore more important to maintain the discipline of its army than to maintain the discipline of other institutions. <p> Military discipline only requires criminal types and punishments that are not in general criminal laws for those who are infected with certain status. These crimes appear as military crimes. In its decisions, the Constitutional Court also stressed that specific and legal principles should not be ignored, as it points to the exceptional structure of the military order. Military Penal Code 1632, on the other hand, does not make the definition of military crime, but does not count only military crimes. Therefore, the principle of specificity and legality is subject to criticism. <p> Dear lawmakers, the law proposal we're discussing determines the exceptions to the investigation and prosecution of military crimes, which will be carried out in the investigation and prosecution of military crimes under the provision of 10 additional articles and 1 temporary clauses in the Military Penal Code No. 1632. <p> On the other hand, the proposal also envisions changes in Turkish Armed Forces Staff Law 926, the Court of Military Courts No. 353, and the Law on Judiciary Law is lifted from effect. <p> The law proposal defines the concept of military crime, which has sparked criticisms on the basis of legal and specificity principles so far, and the concept of ordinary military crimes is counted one by one. As they know, the concept of military crime is based on the establishment of regular armies. He also found a place in the laws of military punishment in Europe. Although military discipline is more effective and deterrent and vital for the implementation of military services, some values are in the protection area of criminal law, the function of military discipline and criminal justice is completely different. <p> Discipline is a long-standing concept that holds the Armed Forces together, which is essential to the carrying out of every task and the basis of military service. Discipline is not only in shape, but also in context, and it naturally includes the basic purpose and methods of the Armed Forces, such as deterrentism, efficiency and law enforcement. A military penal code has been adopted in our country as well as in countries with strong armies, as in the fact that military discipline will not be sufficient for the facility and protection of general criminal laws and that military services must be enforced in order to enforce different rules of law within the military. In this scope, Military Penal Code 1632 was adopted into our legal system in 1930, while the Court of Military Courts No. 353 and Judiciary Law was passed in 1963. However, military crimes are not defined in the laws of the military, nor are they considered military crimes. Instead, the results of military crime and military crime alone were staged. <p> Honourable lawmakers, the concept of military crime, which has emerged along with the existence of military penal laws, may result in the implementation of different and exceptional provisions, compared to the sanctions committed by the general penal code. General penal laws may contain softer and more liberal provisions in terms of sanctions, but there are even more deterrent provisions in the military penal code, which serves the purpose of protecting military interests and military discipline. <p> Today, military crimes are divided in doctrines and juvies. First, military crimes, and second, military crimes. For military crime alone, it is imperative that the perpetrator be a soldier; it is not possible for non-military to commit a military crime. For example, in Article 87 of the Military Penal Code, the charge of persistent disobedience to the order, or the charge of regular desertion on Article 66, is unique only by those in military service and duty. <p> Honourable lawmakers are intended to maintain and maintain public order through disciplinary rules for those in the military profession, to maintain the facility and continuity of discipline, to preserve the honor and dignity of the military profession. When we look at the other regulations in the law proposal as the topics in which we are talking, there are no additional provisions to be taken into consideration in terms of criminal or superior relationship; there will be additional provisions to be carried out in the arrest and arrest of soldiers; there will be exceptional provisions for investigating and prosecution of military crimes; there will be important measures to be made by the State Department of Defense; there will be important legislation to be made in the military crimes committed by people under the Supreme Court; there will be a decision on permission and permission of the prosecution; there will be a trial for military crimes; there will be a trial to be a trial; there will be an investigation and a trial to be a trial for military crimes; there will be an investigation. <p> On the other hand, we find it important that military service and discipline be taken care of under the Military Penal Code. It should also be assessed that decisions can be made in a way that gives less room to describe the action and to determine the punishment than can be appreciated. The basic and universal principles of law should be taken into consideration, as well as the legal state, security and freedom of persons, the right to a fair trial, the subject to judicial control of all actions and procedures of the administration. <p> Honourable lawmakers are indirectly effective in the formation of the military judicial system, as well as their strategic positions, positions and historical history in the fight against power, and national traditions. Today our country is located at the centre of the world's most strategic region, the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East triangle. Turkey is in a state of great potential in the region with both military power and national stance. Thus, as it has been so far, our country will now face any danger from the inside and the outside. <p> In short, as a strong army is needed, discipline in this great and powerful army requires a strong and stable judicial system for the continuation of order and success. In this regard, the proposal envisions resolving the current judicial system, and as a result, the event will increase in military discipline. In discipline, every member of our historic and famous hero army will have a higher sense of loyalty and discipline. Let it not be forgotten that the Turkish military has set an example of the organizational structure, discipline and education of many foreign government armies. <p> Honourable MPs; Turkish Armed Forces, NATO, the United Nations, the European Security and Co-operation Agency, operate successfully within international institutions, such as the European Union. At the same time, it contributes to global peace and stability in Kosovo, Bosnia, Qatar, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan and many international areas under bilateral agreements. In addition to all these activities, the Turkish Armed Forces continue to train their staff in the best possible way to improve the quality of today's development and the changing structure of war. From our helicopter to our drones, smart ammunition, missiles, infantry guns, armored vehicles, and electronic warfare systems, the systems our heroic army needs and uses are now largely domestic and national. <p> At this point, I'd like to remind you once again that the whole world is talking about Turkey's especially breakthrough in defence and aviation. In particular, the success of our drones is on the agenda in many countries' media. In international articles on how our SIHA had changed the course of war in Libya, where the regime had stopped the attacks in Syria, the whole world has witnessed that Azerbaijan had a large share of the SIHA in his success against Armenia. <p> Another source of pride is our export numbers in the defence and aviation sector. According to the Ministry of Trade and Turkish Exporters' Assembly, Turkey exported $1 billion 120m during the January-May 2021 period, with a 51 per cent increase in defence and aviation from the same period last year. Our armed forces, which are among the world's elite armies and are dazzled by the defence industry, ranked 11th in the report of the year 2021 of the United States-based Global Firepower. <p> Our Heroic Armed Forces continue to fight abroad and abroad against organisations such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the NYD-<PARTY>G and the DEAS. According to the latest figures, from July 24, 2015, we are proud to report that 18,196 terrorists have been neutralized. Turkey's position as a deterrent in its territory has continued to disturb some external forces from far away. These traitors targeted the Turkish army to eliminate Turkey's deterrent. Ergenekon, Sledgehammer conspiracies, attacks on traitors and black propaganda have always been carried out for the same reason. However, once again, history is not impossible for Turkish people. It shows that it is not possible. <p> In the hearts of the nation, the most reliable Turkish army shows that it is at the service of the Turkish nation at all times, in a steely stance. Today we are with our heroic security forces, from Cyprus to blue country, east and southeast to Syria, from northern Iraq to the Iranian border, and from abroad to many missions, our hearts and our prayers are with them. Trust in his friends with his present power, our heroic army, which gives fear to his enemies, will continue to follow his principles and teachings in the way that Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk has pointed and aimed at. Whoever opposes this successful and determined struggle by our glorious army and our heroic Mehmet-chik, our other security guards, will find the <PARTY>, as it has been for fifty-two years. <p> Once again, with these thoughts and feelings, I salute the General Assembly, saying that we support the entire proposal of the law, and I wish it to bring blessings to our country. <p> Have a nice evening.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the Millitarian Movement Party Group on behalf of the National Movement Party's Party on behalf of the Proposal for the Approvement of Cultural Business Union Protocol between the Turkish Republic's Government and the Government of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I salute the Veteran Assembly and your grand delegation. <p> Dear MPs, there is no doubt that for over a hundred years, our brothers and sisters in Cyprus have been fighting for a presence. In 1878, when the island took control of the British, our relatives there had to fight the great pressures. The English colonial tyranny has been inflicted on our relatives as an excuse for the 1931 Greek rebellion. Although everything that reminds the Turkish Republic of Turkey and its native country was banned, the Turkish Cypriot nation has resisted its tongue, religion, culture, and, above all, its commitment to Turkey. In 1955, the Greek terrorist group EOKA, founded to connect the island to Greece, faced the attacks of the EOKA terrorist group, which was established in 1960 as one of the two equal people in the Republic of Cyprus with international agreements, but gave martyrs with the Greek plan to destroy the Turkish Cypriots, lost land, and never compromised their commitment to Turkey. On the basis of 11 years of persecution, the Turkish Cypriot nation, who stood by without compromising Turkish presence under any challenge, was at peace with Operation Peace 1974, and founded the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. Our kinsmen, unfortunately, continue to be isolated from the world by the United Nations' decisions under embargoes. The windpipe of our state, our kinsmen, is the Republic of Turkey. <p> At the final point, there are infrastructure problems in northern Cyprus, where I live and am a citizen. Our Internet infrastructure is very weak, the fiber optic network must come because it's not even 3G healthy right now. There's a lot of energy and electricity shortages. You wouldn't believe the bills in Cyprus when electricity prices are being discussed in Turkey, so we need to move to solar power plants immediately. The Five Finger Mountains can be shut down by solar panels. Experts must find a solution, and Cyprus must build electricity and internet networks. We accomplished a great deal by taking the water of anamur to Cyprus. We understood how important water was to the island when the blackouts occurred this summer. And now we're starting to use the water in agriculture, too. We can also bring electricity with fiber optic cables, just like the water came in. We have no doubt that the foundation of the 500-bed state hospital will be laid off within this year and will be in service very quickly. Cypriot tourism is an essential source of income for both Cyprus and Turkey, but aircraft flights must be increased. It's obvious there's going to be a tourist explosion this season. <p> Before Covid began, nearly 4 million passengers arrived at Ercan Airport in 2019; 2 million people entered and 2 million people left. Most of these passengers are citizens of the Republic of Turkey, about 83 per cent, but the price of aircraft is incredibly high. I can give you an example from Istanbul, an hour and ten minutes from Istanbul to Ercan Airport last week -- economic ticket -- 3,000 liras, how can you bear it? How do we increase Cyprus's tourism in this way? Our problem isn't just the high price of airplanes, we're also taking planes from very few counties. We must certainly increase the location, especially from Bodrum, Dalaman, Gazipaşa, Antwerp, and Tripoli, which is the pupil of tourism in our Republic of Turkey. <p> Anatolian Jet and Turkish Airlines may be damaged by these expeditions, but it's worth the damage to Cyprus. We should also continue our urgent struggle to open Ercan Airport to international campaigns. At this time, we must diversify the sea expeditions from Stoner, Alexander, Alaniah, and Karastones, which should not be left on the back of the Stoner alone. <p> Of course, when you say Cypriot, universities are now educated by about 100,000 students from 103 universities in Cyprus. These students are also volunteers for Cyprus in the country where they graduate and leave. In order to increase the number of students from both Turkey and our students from abroad to Cyprus, we must make sure that they are encouraged and encouraged. We need to solve the student housing and housing problem and the transportation problems. <p> Imports and exports between Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus must be made through Turkish lira. Our brothers in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus must also give up the love of pounds. <p> Open sea fishing in our country's coves can be moved by incentives to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, because at the moment this open seamanship in our coves is full, and tourism, on the one hand, is causing incredible pollution in our open naval coves. There are not many coves in Cyprus, my dear friends, so it can easily encourage open sea fishing to Cyprus, and in open sea fishing the Republic of Northern Cyprus can become a base of this region; it can be easily done. Of course, in Cyprus, an island state, we must also establish the marine trade room. <p> Dear lawmakers have determined our policy on Cyprus in an interview given on January 17, 1921 by the Grand Leader, Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk: the supply roads of the region are blocked as long as Cyprus is in the enemy's hands. Note Cyprus, that this island is important to us. It has demonstrated the strategic importance of Cyprus for Turkey. The island, where our late Prime Minister Alparslan Türkesh Bey was born, has been at the center of the world's agenda for nearly sixty years. In the eastern Mediterranean, the sovereignty of international agreements and natural gas rights are combined, and it is sought to be averted by the Greeks. We'll never let that happen. The Cypriot policy must be formed by national policies, independent of the internal policy of both Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and the state must be maintained and maintained with its mind. Turkish Cypriotism is ready to decide its own fate, to cut its own umbilical cord, and is determined to do so. The decades-old Cyprus talks under the protection of the United Nations have been of no use, so to speak, but we have not been able to travel a length of barley. In this scope, it has been understood that the talks traffic based on the federation means nothing but a two-state solution. The existence of two separate states in Cyprus must now be accepted by everyone. <p> The opening of Maras, kept closed for forty-six years, in accordance with the rights of property, and the opening of this opening to a pilot, who has reached 3.5 per cent of the closed Maras, has unfortunately disturbed many environments. There is no country, no organization above our sovereignty and property rights. Turkish Cypriots also have their will. The power of the Republic of Turkey, thankfully, is with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but above all, the hearts are beating for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I think our Veteran Assembly sees the Cyprus issue over the parties, and all of our MPs believe it. As the National Movement Party, we support the historic and strategic decision of Turkish Cypriots based on equal sovereignty, which will be registered in international status. The fate of Ankara and Cyprus is one, as our President-General, Mr. State Gardener, stated, and Cyprus is our homeland, just as it is our country. <p> I remember the dead Dr. Fazil Minor, the late Rauf Denktas, the saintly martyrs who shed their blood in the Fivefinger Mountains, our mujahideen who were sent to eternity, and our descendants who were massacred in the Armenian tyranny and massacre of Azerbaijan Hodja today thirty years ago. <p> I salute the Veteran Assembly and your grand delegation as I end my words with these feelings and thoughts.\n",

There was a story. HES exploded. Who said that? <p> At the first moment of the flood, the Infractional News Agency told me that HESEs had exploded. Who announced it to the public, Mr. Akbasoglu? <p> You're <PARTY>'s Deputy Group President, you don't know anything. Your former MP, the 26th-century Kastamon MP, declared that HES had exploded. <p> I'm an engineer who wrote a damage assessment report on the area where he had previously been moved by the landslide in 2015; I'm a deputy who will know what he's going to be, whether he's going to explode or not; I'm a deputy who worked there, worked in those pipes for 15 days. We've never had a statement like that anywhere. I'm willing to apologize if anyone brought this statement and proved it. But if you think we're not going to ask where this 996 trillion-dollar money is being spent by cunningly reducing the whole flood to HES. By creating opposition and polarizing, you're wrong. I am the son of this land, and I do not give to any soul what is due to it, and we will continue to ask about it. <p> But if you're so curious about this HES, set up the research commission, and let's go, together, to the mountains, to the hills, where none of you have ever been. Let us see together where the sands were poured out when the HES was made, what caused the landslide, and what houses in the stream where the trees were left thirsty, and what houses did they die in. Come and say yes, if you have one. <p> He's a 26th-century MP, and I'd like to call myself a Zul, if you know what I mean. <p> Murat Demir is a member of the United States <p> Okay, I said it.\n",

You're all witnesses to the investments we've raised to $1,200,000 for our healthcare workers to work in a better environment and to invest in health infrastructure for you to get better services. For 20 years, we have been working to increase the quality of health care and quantity. A health care system where all of our citizens can receive equal health care is our joy. <p> We are grateful for the health care of our health workers, especially as we all see in the pandemic. We've always expressed our efforts to resolve our healthcare workers' financial, self-inflicted shortcomings in recent years, and with this law, we want to address their problems. We're improving our doctors' pensions. He proposes this improvement by raising the additional payment indicator from 17,000 to 26,000 in expert medical examiners, from 13,000 to 20,000 in the medical examiners, and hopefully we'll be legalizing it in a little while. And our working doctors are improving their performance, or additional payments, and we're combining the amount of money that we've been known to be called \"sabit payment\" into a single payroll, which is better than the pension bonus -- which, you know, you've always said -- and we're improving it with additional payment indicators. <p> For performance payments to be more fair, balanced and better between hospitals, we're giving the budget to our health ministry's central administration about performance payments. Well, there's no problem with the inclusion, actually, when we raise the additional pay ceiling, that won't be a problem. <p> Some of our citizens, who have received health care but have not been able to pay it, are being paid off and some are being made easier. <p> After the laws of health violence, malpractis, we will continue to work for our health workers, as is our proposal for this law today, which includes improving the rights of financial and autonomy. <p> I wish our laws to our doctors, to our health workers, to our nation, to our country, to all those who have gone through with it.\n",

            "Text: Thank you, Mr. President. <p> Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute you all. <p> We presented a group of proposals today: let's bring out the moves that have been involved in the execution of illegal decisions, examine illegal trials, expose those who have played a role in illegal decisions involving political and judicial members, all of which are damaging legal security, so we said to open up a parliamentary investigation; we gave a few examples of our co-chair's trial -- in the law -- we gave you information; you rejected it with your votes. You refused, we understood that, but you went out and read the 138th article of the Constitution, and you said: \"The judges are independent. No body, authority, authority or person can ask questions about the use of judicial authority, they can't negotiate, they can't make any statements. We say, \"We doubt that attempts have been made to influence the judiciary,\" we say, \"Let's look into it,\" you say, \"The constitution can't be done according to 138. <p> Now, with all due respect, think of it this way: murder has been committed, investigate. The prosecutor says murder is a crime, but he does nothing. The prosecutor says torture is a crime. He does nothing. The prosecutor says that corruption is a crime, but he doesn't do anything. That's exactly what you're doing. You can't cover up illegalities by reminding me of the legal text. <p> Look, the European Court of Human Rights said that on November 20, 2018, the decision to arrest our Co-Chair, Mr. Milahattin Demirtaş, was against the European Convention on Human Rights. For the first time, he decided to violate the 18th article, the first time in a period of 30 years from 1990 to 2020. What does that mean? The judicial bodies in Turkey are making political decisions, he said. There is a warrant for the arrest of Demirtaş. He said to stop his political work. And what did you do? What should a government have to do to respect judgment, judgment, law? What should the court in this country do? That should do the trick. What did you do? You said, \"We'll make our move, we'll let it go to waste.\" You also said that this decision is not final, we will apply for an apartment. He repeated exactly what you said, and the court did not issue an eviction order on the province of Demirtaş, and decided to continue his arrest. <p> Now, by the way, you did one more thing when you realized that the big apartment would decide in favor of you. Look, before this November, September, September 18th, Istanbul 26th. The High Criminal Court sentenced Mr. Demirtaş to four years and eight months in prison for one speech; no example of propaganda in Turkey's history. Within two and a half months, on December 4th, the Istanbul District Court of Justice approved the verdict. Why? You convicted Mr. Demirtaş because you knew that the large apartment would approve the evacuation decision, but that didn't mean anything because he could have been released when he was released from the other detention period. The lawyers applied, and said: \"Let him be released and let him be released.\" On the day they made this application, the court had no other way but to accept it. On the day of this application, the Ankara Chief Prosecutor has added Mr. Demirtaş regarding October 6-8 has made him a suspect in a five-year investigation and in a case that Mr. Demirtaş is not a suspect; he has made Mr. Demirtaş a suspect in the October 6th; he has demanded that he be arrested at night. The judge on duty was being treated at the hospital, they brought him back to the courthouse, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr. Demirtaş. On the other hand, Mr. Demirtaş was already on trial for the October 6th or 8th incident, and Ankara Heavy Penal Court had issued an eviction order from that file. <p> Let me tell you something more dramatic, for the record: The Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor who did this, Mr. Demirtaş, five years later added Mr. Demirtaş to the case he was not a suspect in. The Ankara Public Prosecutor had visited Mr. President in the palace a day ago. What a coincidence, huh? <p> I salute you all.\n",

Even in relations with the regional Kurdish administration, we would point to the central government. So everything would go through the Iraqi Central Government. Over the past five years, relations with the central government have been pushed aside, relations with the regional Kurdish administration have been highlighted. <p> Of course, Turkey's problems with Iraq began when relations with the central government were pushed into the background. In Iraq, Baghdad, there is a Shiite government, a dominant Shiite government. We know you're uncomfortable with this stuff. Turkey, unfortunately, has not been able to achieve balance in the region in that time. <p> See, in the last five years, we've even forgotten the number of tribes that we've invited to Turkey -- before we invaded ISIS Mosul, and the north of Baghdad. We invited all the Sunni tribes to Turkey, left the state aside, all the Sunni tribes came to Turkey. They ate, drank, talked, made plans, and vowed to Abu Bakir Bağdadi on 11 June 2014. <p> Look, is this what politics is like? Is that what we're looking at, that we're directing, that we're developing relationships, that the tribe should have come to this conclusion? Because relations with the government have not been developed, the state has been turned away. <p> Look, it's the same thing with the Bashika camp. What's the problem? Why is there a problem with the Bashika camp? Because we didn't want to take these things with Baghdad. He went at the invitation of the former ex-Musul governor, who was discharged, and they went after him. Then he was briefed. But if they were given information, if they were approved -- once, for one thing, information, for another -- and they were approved, why are they against it now? Why do they insist the United Nations Security Council that we report you within 48 hours, what happened? Are they the only hypocrites, are they the hypocrites? Isn't there something wrong with us? On the one hand in our relations with Baghdad, we support the integrity of Baghdad, we support its independence, we do all sorts of things that violate its independence and territorial integrity. Is that what neighborhood policy is like? <p> See, the balances in the region are different, it's not easy to read Iraq from here, it's important to study in the center, where you should study in the field. In Iraq, balances change every day. The best way was with the central government again, because the great states, the great states, the US, Iran, Russia, they're all doing business with the central government, and we passed it on. <p> Now, in the State Department's statement, it is called \"Musul\" from \"integration.\" It is called \"coordinated.\" What's the departure from Mosul? It means don't move. They can't say it's polite, but they say it's natural. What's \"retribution\"? It's a withdrawal of soldiers, a withdrawal of soldiers, a retreat of the soldier you sent ten days ago, ten days later, nothing more. There's been a lack of coordination. It's called a lack of coordination. Why did it happen? If it's true, why did it happen? So we've come to a point where we can't even coordinate these relations with Baghdad anymore, and we think that if we try to coordinate, they won't let us, so it comes to this. We need to understand that. The same thing happens in Syria. Once upon a time, no matter what happened, it happened, and then it happened. So what happened? Today, Iraq was divided by ISIS, regional Kurdish administration, and actually by Sunnis. Today the terms of the reunification of Iraq were eliminated. Mr. Secretary just said we want to plan the post-Ishid strategy. What, did we have a pre-Isil strategy so we could plan the rest? (HISIL) For a year and a half, ISIS has been controlling it, there, ISIS has raped people, ISIS has destroyed all cities, looted, ISIS has seized everything; what did you do before ISIS, and what would you do next? <p> Look, I'm telling you clearly: Turkey must improve its relations with Iraq. We're not against military possession, but what's the point? Why do we keep soldiers there? What if we have a strategy after ISIS? Do we want to make that area a Sunni area? Do we want to take Mosul (Musul) and join the Kurdish regional administration? Do we want to take him back to central administration? What do we want to do? Somebody come out and explain the next strategy to me, please. <p> So we don't know about this? Haven't we been through here? For God's sake, don't kid him! What strategy are you talking about? There is no strategy for ISIS, and there is no strategy after ISIS. The period after ISIS will be more bloody. ISIS will leave because the terrorist organization will never be able to control it forever, somehow the international coalition, local forces will clean it up. Not this year, next year, but there's no future for ISIS, because there's no way that such a vicious organization could possibly have a future there. <p> So, what's our strategy? Why did these soldiers go there? What was their purpose there? If they can save Mosul, will 600 soldiers save Mosul? Or will Mosul be saved by our hand and given to someone? What should we understand from here? Now, here's where the mistake is, look. <p> Second, we are fighting ISIS in Mosul. Where's Mosul? There's a regional Kurdish government at our border that's cutting off Mosul, Mosul's lower. Well, well, there's ISIS on the Mare-Cerablus line, Syria's our neighbor, so why don't we fight it? Why don't we fight there? <p> Look, in Syria, it was said, \"Let Esad go, no matter what.\" What happened today? The PYD, which you consider a terrorist organization, controls a large part of Syria's Mujavir region to our borders. Who controls most of the Cerablus-Mare line? ISIS controls it. El Nusra controls the other area. There's Hezbollah down there, lower down, Assad's stuck. Syria is divided into seven. <p> You listen, please. <p> Listen, please, listen. <p> Were you initially able to predict such a divided Syria? When you made that plan, did you now calculate the post-Isil plan in Musul? Did you calculate Syria after Assad? What happens now in Syria? <p> See, on Friday the United Nations Security Council approved the calendar for the political transition of Syria. If it's run, the transition government will be formed within six months, the constitution will be written. What's happening in Syria in 18 months? We're going to re-election. It was a solution without Assad, and now there's an Assad solution, at least 18 months. It was a non-PYD solution, and the PYD is coming to the table. Your whole policy is upside down. Look, you have to understand that. (CHEERING) We need to get to the truth, the truth. What is the truth? Fact: the region crumbles, shrinks, then shrinks. We couldn't maintain order in the Middle East. We couldn't implement a strategy. We couldn't make a prediction. Start from Libya, through Egypt, out of the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria to Iraq, we fight the whole region, not one country, not one. What's it gonna be? Yeah, there's no limit to selling three pounds of tomatoes down there. What's going to happen? Turkey, on the other hand, is like a migration of tribes, and we're saying that we've taken 5 million people in, we've spent $8 billion. Bravo! Oh, good, $8 billion! Who appreciates you? Who appreciates you?\n",

Now, after this conversation is over, I'm going to thank them and cancel my appointment by calling the same service again. <p> Dear friends, I apologize to Mr. Minister as well, please excuse me: This is the second place in the 1st position of Erzurum Regional Education and Research Hospital, which was in the first position until then, after 167,000 square meters of Diyarbakır Education and Research Hospital was built. So, we're all over it, and frankly, we're kissing the hand we can't bend. <p> Guys, okay, so Diyarbakır's breaking these records, and I guess we're not going to get caught up in this as a hero marquee. We have an important record: we've broken an election record, that's one. Coming up to our second record: Kahramanmarash Regional Education and Research Hospital 81,500 square meters, university hospital friends 11,000 square meters, two of which combined with 1,3,500 square meters, and we're crossing the entire area of the two hospitals. One for this year, one for next year. <p> What I want to say is, friends, is that the Kahramanmarash Regional Education and Research Hospital -- Mr. Minister, I use the name in this way for your tolerance -- we hope to fulfill our promise to you -- will have a Turkish record, and what is that?

I salute you all. <p> Dear friends, first and foremost, I hope, with the vote of the members of the BIE in Paris, I believe Izmir will get the EXPO. Izmir is like EXPO, and EXPO is like Izmir. (<PARTY> and AK PARTY) Because Izmir is such a beautiful city that he is in a position to do it well. Once again, I repeat my wishes for success here, and I know the entire House's sensitivities in this matter, and I want to thank everyone who's done what they've done. <p> Dear friends, in regards to energy policies, the spokesman for the ruling party who just spoke here, as our esteemed Malatya MP said, if everything were to happen and there was a rose of energy policies... <p> Mujahid Bey, yes. <p> If it were like Mujahit Bey said, we would enjoy it as Parliament, we would enjoy it, but in a very important issue such as energy -- close to 20 percent of the total volume of the world's trade in energy -- there's a volume of trade in the world, about 20 percent of its energy -- what about Turkey? Turkey, as my friends have just noted, is a country that loses a crucial point of its current deficit because of its energy source, with a 61 billion-year energy bill. <p> So, what should Turkey do? In this regard, Turkey is not a self-sufficient country in terms of energy resources, as our other friends say, or as it has been accepted by Turkey, is it necessary for us to be dependent on the outside? Should it be subject to a labeling process such as the outside? Should Turkey, using its resources correctly, have a national energy policy in implementing this energy potential as a country with serious potential in energy, and have to take advantage of its external dependence from the outside to the outside? Yes, Turkey should be at this point and must implement such a policy. <p> Turkey's source is not destroyed. Although Turkey's oil is small, when you look at it from a variety point of view, Turkey is a very important country in the middle of geopolitics, geothermal, new biomass and biogas in terms of diversity in the wind and in the sun, and Turkey is in the middle of 67 per cent of the world's energy sources. As long as you have a national energy policy; as long as you are able to fund it; if you are able to match your own energy policy with an independent foreign policy on this matter, then Turkey's resources will be at the highest level. <p> Dear friends, as the <PARTY>, we propose a three-way structure in energy: Renewable resources must bring one-third of energy, be domestic, and one-third must be dependent on the outside. <p> Right now, we are 72 per cent dependent on the energy policies of the <PARTY>, and a very important part of this external dependency came from agreements with Russia -- both nuclear and natural gas. <p> If you become so dependent on a country in no country in the world, including the European Union and America, you have no chance of providing energy supply security in that country. Unfortunately, Turkey is at a very serious point of dependency on energy supply security today. Unfortunately, as he did not invest in his own resources at the point of using his own resources, as well as in the latest law, a powerful organisation, such as the Turkish Oil Anonymal Association, has been removed from their policies of research, development and investment in Turkey, more effective in international agreements, more efficient in resources and licensing, and Turkey is at a very serious point in energy, where we have no power to look for them in accordance with the demands of international institutions; let foreigners come, seek them. In their understanding, our domestic resources have become the search areas of international capital, which are also dependent on domestic resources. <p> My dear friends, look, I'd like to give you one more insight into this. Energy is very important in the industrialisation policies of a country, very important in the welfare community, energy is the most important resource for people's modern life, to be reached, to be reached at the cheapest. But Turkey is at an extremely expensive point in both industrial and citizen energy. As far as the latest numbers are concerned, both countries in the world that have access to oil have dropped to a negative point, and we're using our oil sources as we increase. With 6.7 percent energy... while other countries reduce energy costs, we increase 6.7 percent. Turkey, which does not have the chance to compete with such increasing energy and electricity sources in the world, needs to do this with this motion today: study energy policies, see what mistakes we make in energy policies. Besides, Turkey is the cheapest energy that we can call energy efficiency and save energy. With its understanding, it takes no action on energy efficiency, with constructions that were built before 2000, our energy losses today are extremely high, and Turkey stays out of the point of doing its best to maintain our major hydropower plants that were built before this, not even in order to maintain enough efficiency from them. <p> At the point where Germany, with less resources than us in the sun, meets its need for solar energy approaching 20 per cent recently, Turkey has been at the point of viewing solar energy. In this process, unfortunately, we've come to this point today because we haven't taken the necessary steps in the Renewable Energy Law, which is about the support for renewable energy, even though we are an internationally behind-the-world resource in both technologically and solar use. Likewise, in the wind, today we have a serious problem with our energy sources. <p> My dear friends, the <PARTY> knows that we are prepared to invest in access to energy and energy. In doing so, we are environmentally sensitive, environmentally sensitive, but we believe that energy supply security is important for the development of a country, for it to be a modern country, that it has to reach citizens at the right price and at the cheapest. <p> You do not have the chance to shape Turkey's future today with an energy policy that you have left energy and electricity today, especially from state support, through privatisations, leaving distribution areas directly into the private sector, avoiding investing, and leaving the investment of the private sector at the point of making money from the citizens' pockets. <p> Yes, in Turkey, energy is an independent foreign policy, as well as foreign policy. Rather than having zero problems with their neighbors, if there is serious weakness in the foreign policy of a troubled country with each neighbour, energy policies will also be severely weak. <p> For him, this issue needs to be investigated, re-examined, create a national energy policy, and for this policy to be created, all parties need to decide together within the framework of a national policy. Therefore, I find this motion positive, that we will support it as the <PARTY>, and I salute your peace.\n",

As we celebrate all of our clubs that represent us abroad, which bring this kind of sweat, I congratulate Sivasspor. I've had a chance to watch a few of your struggles in place. God willing, I wish you many successes. Of course, we are closely monitoring the treatment they face with our Federation, our Foreign Ministry, our relevant embassies, our foreign diplomatic missions. I'd like to express that we are personally followers of this, as no Turkish athlete would be willing to allow any Turkish team to be treated wrongly in any way by the Turkish club. <p> Our MP, Ms. Arzu Erdem, is one of the most important projects we care about. In that sense, thank you for bringing it up. I haven't had a chance to give you a lot of detailed information on the stand. Swimming, you know, is one of the basic disciplines, like athletics, like gymnastics. At this point, we have a plan to teach swimming to anyone who wants to learn how to swim, and we have a project. And in that sense, praise be to God, 2020, we've captured our target with pandemics, and hopefully we're working on a very surprising target for 2021. Because we have so many water sources, so many pools that we've built, and our water supply is very rich. Swimming is also a very useful sport, both internationally and in health at the performance point. We're going to strengthen this project with her husband, her young and her senior, hopefully in 2021, and I believe that in 81 districts of Turkey, we're going to work together with the Ministry of National Education, with our clubs, with our governorships, with our municipalities, we're going to raise swimmers, and we're going to take an important step on the road to Turkey, which is swimming in the future with health. I invite all of our deputies to share the same excitement at the point of our swim campaign. <p> There's no time left? <p> Yeah, let me just say one thing about addiction. <p> Look, addictions are one of our biggest challenges -- not just substance abuse, but digital addictions in every area, and all of our ministry's activities are actually a means of dealing with addiction, and in this sense, hopefully, in 2021, the labor units that I've just mentioned are very important to us. All institutions, organizations, volunteers, sports community, we're going to hold hands, and hopefully we're going to do a stronger job on addictions. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, members of parliament, I'm starting to call you MPs, of course, but unfortunately, there's not 95 percent of Parliament here, especially not members of the <PARTY>. Surely the Lord of the Worlds has given all knowledge, and has put it in their breasts, and they do not need to hear. Those who have already listened... those who do not accept... are accepted. Or not. They say what they want, they have no purpose. Anyway, let's start talking to the General Assembly again. <p> Is there anything wrong with what I said? If you have it, go ahead. <p> Yes, my dear friends, today I have taken a pledge on the budget of the President of the Religious Affairs, the President of the Foreign Turks and Relative Community, the President of the Turkish Co-operation and Co-ordination Agency. <p> Last year, I had a long, detailed conversation about the chairmanship of Religious Affairs -- and I had more time. Starting with the history of religion, from Christianity, from Judaism, from the position of sheikulism, here, from Byzantine relations of the Byzantine state, from Byzantine Republic of Turkey to Ottomans, from Ottomans to Turkish Republic. At that time, however, the answers given by our Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the Diabetes, who had also graduated from the seminary, were even simpler and more irrelevant than the answers given by an imam-responsive student. I don't want to go into all this stuff because I have a limited time today and I need to talk about other things. Just a brief summary, and I'd like to end my conversation with the touching, so to speak. <p> Dear friends, there's been a lot of talk about religion. First and most importantly, when I get a chance to talk about this at almost every opportunity, I say that religion is not at the government's disposal. There are four or five professors of theology I know in the EC PARTI, including the other members of the government, including the Deputy Prime Minister, including professors of professors and doctors. The professors of theology, I'm speaking to all the friends who've been trained to say, \"Come, come out and say, if you can say that religion may be under the government's law of Islam.\" If you can say that, be it lawful, the rest is a myth, demagogy is a punctuation, and I'll say it in three languages. That is the first great sin. In secular governance, religion does not belong to the state, neither in an Islamic government that has a religious basis for reference. So is this Imamazam, according to Abu Hanife, and according to Imam Malik, and according to Imam Shafii, and according to Imam Hanbel, and according to Imam Jafer, and according to the 12 Imamites. If anyone claims otherwise, let them come forward and say otherwise. Abu Hanife of Imamaazam stood up to Abbasi caliph, a bearded man, a pendejo, who prayed five times in prayer, and died in torture. So, why don't you autonomize this Diet or leave religion to civil society? <p> Speaking of which, I also have a criticism for <PARTY>. Every chance they get, they say this AK PARTY has a secret agenda. These are the lawmakers, these are religious people, they want to establish a theocratic government. They have no concern about forming a religious government, building an Islamic government, no concerns about building a liberal democratic democracy, because if they had a claim to establish an Islamic government, the first thing they would have done was to free religion again, if they wanted to establish a liberal democratic legal system, they would still have to sever the bond of religion, separate religion, leave religious affairs to civil society. There is never such a thing, you criticize it in the wrong place, and with this wrong way of criticizing it, you make it stronger when you're constantly trying to weaken power. I'd appreciate it if you'd consider this a warning. <p> Dear friends, why does the dianetite need to be left in the civilian area? Like I said, I told you last year with all the historical references, I'm not going to repeat it this year. But today, the president of the Religious Affairs is under the control of deep structures more than the National Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council, the General Staff's military intelligence -- in a nail. And as a matter of fact, before and after September 12th, a president of the Dianet Affairs, who was said to have very close ties with the National Intelligence Agency and even had an employee, brought his night into the day and day to strengthen the national religious structures against the national opinion and other structures at the time of the organisation of all the Islamic councils and organisations in Europe. <p> We ask at this point: If this Religion is not in a line of Turkish Islamists and Hanefi, why don't our citizens of Alevi have demands? Two: We have Shiite citizens in Turkey, especially the Iğdır region. Why aren't the Religious Affairs working on these things, depending on the Jafari sect? And again, there's an important Shafii population in Turkey, why doesn't it work on them? <p> I'm giving you questions, and the answers are a celebration to the houses: \"Sir, we're not looking at Shafii, Hanefi, Maliki when we're giving a fatwa, we're answering the question of the citizen by studying all the sects. We ask: \"Can you preach in Kurdish in mosques? \" Again, there is no proper answer. Brother, if you speak in the name of Islam, you say it can or cannot be given. Wheresoever he is given, how he shall be given, and how he shall be given. This is a separate issue of discussion.\n",

Prior to the AK PARTY authorities, the price of tea was explained according to the projected inflation, as was the price of all agricultural products. Inflation that happened was always above the target, and the manufacturer always lost. In addition, the cost of age tea was made in the next year, and the inflation caused him to lose from here. <p> In the AK PARTI administrations, the price of tea is always determined by plus prosperity above inflation. The tea sold by the customer is paid not in the next year, but in the next month.

In the words of Mr. State Gardener Bey, Ataturk is Turkey; Ataturk is the republic; Ataturk is the architect of the call of the man who calls himself \"Happy Turk\" with golden letters carved into the machi conscience. To cherish him, to respect him, to remain faithful to his works, is a duty and assignment for every generation of Turkish children. <p> Dear lawmakers, relations between Turkey and Qatar based on common historical and cultural ties have recently been strategically based on mutual trust. The approach of the Qatar administration and its people towards our country is extremely positive. <p> Qatar is the head of countries that have shown strong solidarity with our country in the face of July 15 coup attempt. Following the coup attempt, it was the first country to declare support for our country. Qatar supported the adoption of the Turkish-Körfez Co-operation Council in Riyadh on 13 October 2016 of the High Level Strategic Dialogue Foreign Ministers' 5th Meeting. With that support, the first international organisation to recognise ا as a terrorist organisation was the Gulf Co-operation Council. <p> On 5 June 2017, our country began exporting its products to Qatar's urgent needs with cargo planes of age, fruits and milk, in the face of embargos and economic sanctions that the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt's four of the Arab Four, had broken diplomatic relations with Qatar on land, air and sea roads. <p> On August 15, 2018, Qatar Emir Temim visited our country in response to speculations in the exchange rate, which targeted our economy during the summer of 2018. With these steps, our country is building a solid security architecture and creating a military and political influence for itself. <p> Deliable MPs, the letter of the Union's intention to fulfil the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of Qatar was signed in Ankara on 31 October 2019. It's a letter of intent between two countries; <p> a) A mutual review of the legislation that defines the duties and powers of the two parties regarding large-scale organisations, <p> B) Shared experience in implementing and planning hosting procedures related to large-scale organisations <p> C) Anti-crime measures during the event of large-scale organisations, <p> ) Anti-terrorism measures, <p> D) It will enable cooperation in the areas of providing participation in field work on hosting large-scale organisations. <p> The letter of intent signed with the friendly and brother Qatar government will strengthen our cooperation in the security field in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar will host at his request. The aim of the deal is to establish a legal framework for security co-operation in the implementation of anti-crime and terrorism measures in large international organisations hosted by both countries. Security co-operation agreements signed with foreign countries, especially terrorism and organised crime, provide direct communication and contact between our security units, a basis for further development of our bilateral co-operation. We face organised crime based on terrorism and terrorism, which the global world considers a common threat, the most dangerous form of crime that defies human life and security, defies the authority of states. Today, it is a fact that it is not possible for countries to achieve success in combating organised crime based on terrorism and terrorism alone. Therefore, it is important to have a bilateral and multilateral co-operation between friendly countries. <p> There is a Security Co-operation Agreement between Turkey and Qatar in 2001. With this agreement, there were a number of soldiers in Qatar, and 700 soldiers were sent with a new agreement and a review in the second decade of the 2000s. In this bilateral relationship with Qatar, a network of economic power, potential, and relationship networks in the Gulf, it is undoubtedly the interests of our country that concern and make Turkey special. These agreements, in favor of both sides, have deepened and deepened relations between the two countries. <p> Dear lawmakers, 27% of the natural gas reserve -- which is valued as a substitute for oil -- is found in Qatar, after Russia and Iran. After 1971, Qatar's original source of wealth shifted from oil to natural gas with the largest natural gas reserve discovery. As a result, Qatar produces and exports more liquefied natural gas than any other state in the world. <p> During our visit to Qatar on February 23, 2020 (May 29, 2021) with the Turkish Inter-Catar Friendship Group and the Grand National Assembly Foreign Commission delegation to Qatar on 29 May 2021), the most important factor we have observed as a delegation was the welfare level of the Qatar people, and today it is over 60 thousand dollars per person per person in Qatar. <p> The wealth acquired on the basis of natural resources has significantly increased the quality of life for the Qatars. Qatar, who guarantees energy supply security for developed and developing countries, is therefore nominated to become one of the world's power centers with its income, shines as the pearl of the Persian Gulf. <p> Today, Turkey's first national drilling ship, Fatih, one of the most important steps in Turkey's full independent energy movement, began its first drilling in the Black Sea location of Tuna-1 on 20 July 2020; about a month later, on 22 August 2020, a historic discovery was discovered at the Sakarya gas field Danube-1 well. Thus, the total discovery of gas in the Black Sea reached 540 billion cubic metres. That's enough to satisfy our country's 12 years of need. The discovery of gas in the Danube-1 well was recorded as the world's largest discovery in deep seas, and among all gas explorations, the 2nd largest discovery of the year. <p> As the late Osman Ascendant Serdentı has described in the city without Sanctuary, we are once the children of a long-standing race that ruled three continents and seven seas. We have complete faith that in this industrial war, we will reach the 2023-leading country of Turkey, with the support of our nation's Cumhur Alliance, as regional actor country, with our national and original production, in the steps we take in the local industry. <p> As I put an end to my remarks, I respectfully welcome the General Assembly to say that the Approval of the Business Union Letter on Companies between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of Qatar, which is appropriate for both countries, should be a blessing.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, the esteemed lawmakers have been delivered a very undramatic but very gentlemanly mission. I, too, offer my best wishes to our friend, Altay, and Special, and to the newly elected Ozkoc. And I wish you all the best in your future political life. <p> I told you at a meeting earlier that what we're talking about is no more than my point of view, or rather, it's not a subject. I think it's imperative that the Constitution was made due to a ruling on the introduction of international contracts to parliament due to the 90th article, and moreover, in the previous constitutional amendments, I think that's the point where the opposition should be cut off, especially in matters you've been wasting time talking about. I wish you could take more time and time from the other place because we're talking about a technicality. The international issues are determined at a certain point in technical matters, and they come here as approval. Other contracts, usually already secret agreements, other serious agreements between governments don't come here. <p> To illustrate: After the 1950s, secret agreements between Celal Bayar and the United States came out thirty years later, the deals that are resolving today, especially to İncirlik Base in Turkey. The bilateral agreements between Abdullah Gul and Powell were only leaked to the press eight years later. So many of our friends, unfortunately, have deviated from the core of the issue, or, in fact, given up their work of expressing something, began to talk about the issues of the daily agenda in comparison. <p> So speaking of contracts, at least I felt compelled to say a few words about it. Here I felt more compelled to say a few words about the anti-emperical calls of the spokesman for the National Movement Party and the anti-American, anti-European talks that have recently been happening in our country. <p> It was February 6, 1969, even February 10, 1969. American 6. I remember when the fleet wanted to land in Istanbul. I was a student at the time. 6. Representatives of the right-wing mentality continued to accuse all of us of the anti-emperical acts of the fleet's non-progression to Turkey. Being an anti-empericalist is a political line, not a revelation that comes in a day, not something you'll wake up on in a day like a stone. I see that in their youth, the Sea Travelers and their friends, the children of our 69 and 68 generations, who have accused people of fighting anti-empericalism, are trying to manipulate politics with anti-empiralist slogans that will be their replacement at that time. <p> Being anti-emperical is a true line, a beautiful line, but it depends on you building politics where you can carry the load. Yesterday, when you had another collaboration with the United States, Russia, I would like to close this point by saying that it is not useful for the country to move to the anti-emperical line in terms of whether or not there is a conflict of interest today. <p> Recently, one of the most talked-about issues in the days is the talk of our President, or rather the style and procedure of the mayors in the EC PARTI that has allowed them to step down. <p> The mayor's office, from my point of view, is a very sacred mission, and when I came into the world, when I thought about it, I had two desires: I wanted to do my job as a lawyer, and I wanted to do my job as a mayor in politics. Because mayoral office is really the understanding of a free mind to run that city, and it's like a painter, the mayor must be set free. It shouldn't be like a multi-husband Hürmuz, mayor. So he must be free from an understanding of numerous guardianship authorities and individuals, such as the sword of Damocles. Therefore, while mayors' arrivals and departures are based on the law, we need to explore the landscape that we face today. <p> I called him a lawyer, and I really wanted to be a lawyer. I was a lawyer for ten and a half years. I'd be a lawyer if I came into the world again, but I don't think I'm going to be a lawyer any more. Why don't I think about it? Because I have seen with my eyes that the prosecutors and judges, who I will seek rights before him, have come to the point of being deprived of their knowledge, knowledge of the law, and knowledge of their savings, that their education is inadequate. <p> This is called careful attention, and I want you to watch and follow this, especially from our fellow ruling lawmakers: 12,000 to 13,000 judges and prosecutors in this country have been kicked out of the ranks. That's right. The procedures are certainly legal, and I have no objection, but isn't it because you expect the judges and prosecutors you've replaced to distribute justice? You sent it to make sure that justice and law were done. <p> They're so incompetent that I'm putting aside your partisanism, your instructions... the courts' decisions are written for reasons, and the grounds are based on the analysis of witnesses and events in criminal cases, and if it's a legal case, it's based on written documents. See, I'm telling you the verdict of a criminal court, which says, \"I sentenced you to two to five years.\" I'm talking about a signed, finalized court order. ▪ Where does two and five years come from? It's the law. The law has ruled the judge's discretion. You can't distribute justice, you can't deliver justice, you can't distribute justice with a judge who's 26 or four months old. <p> That's why you pay attention. Surely there is a serious lack of justice in this matter... in the matter of freeing us from prejudice, at least from judges and prosecutors who are equipped with information. It's a very serious effort. Especially if the judges and prosecutors in this court have become political... because we don't have a very good history in this matter either... from the will courts to the state security courts, to the martial law courts. <p> The tools of the court, which hanged Deniz Gezmişi, were one maviser and one Gizkale pistol. They didn't even have the means to take down the government's customs, but those friends, 26 years old, were executed in the name of the Turkish nation by the court of the Republic of Turkey. Therefore, if the judgment is political, it is futile to seek rights, to seek law. <p> Unfortunately, I see you've come to the point that without the fact that we have two co-Chairs, nine of our MPs, without the one sentence they say on the stand, we haven't been able to bring them to trial for 15 months. In addition, three or four of our MPs, unfortunately, who don't know how to count, have been condemned by judges who have spoken such words as eight years, four years, ten years, and so forth. Therefore, we complain of justice. The way to settle this complaint is through the construction of a full legal state. When you say a full legal state, the Constitution is at the top of it. There's no chance it's an unconstitutional and illegal country. <p> Now, for days now, the main opposition party, other parties, TV programs are screaming out loud, sir, as if the resignation of mayors is not legal or illegal, or there are those who argue about its legality. For God's sake, isn't it in the Constitution how the prime minister came in this country, how he went? Mr. Ahmet Davutoglu, wasn't elected by 49 per cent? Mr. Ahmet Davutoglu, have you seen a young man who has been involved in this Parliament, has he received a vote of insecurity? No. What happened? It could have been fabricated, called in, resigned, called in, given willingly. I don't want to wear a handle with any other interpretation. What'd you say? This way, Mr. Ahmet. This way, Mr. Bali. You get out of this car, and you get in, Mr. Bali. Didn't he try? With this understanding that the prime ministers have changed in an environment where the Constitution is in effect, you have forced five mayors, plus 1 mayors in Turkey, and there is not much to discuss. Why? That's what willpower wanted. <p> Well, don't these friends have the right to law because it's what the will wants? Yes, but it's also something that comes from a politician's personality. Politicians, do these people deserve it or not? What would his reaction be if he didn't deserve it? <p> I'd like to give you a few examples, if I may. Turkey is founded in 1979 as Ecevit government and publicly as Turan Sun foreign minister. I'm a member of the group board. Ecevit called Mr. Sun. He's got an hour and a half left. The other ministers left in ten minutes, five minutes, an hour and a half. Why did yours take so long? We said, \"Why did yours take so long?\" He offered me the ministry of justice, and in public, my name is Turan Sun, the minister of foreign affairs. What he said to the late Ecevit is that if you don't consider me worthy of the foreign ministry, I don't accept the justice ministry you're offering. The sentence is exactly like this and does not accept the ministry of justice. <p> Hasan Assat Iş, Minister of National Defence, came because the Chief of General Staff walked two meters in front of him at a ceremony -- such as these friends' farewell ceremony -- has resigned from the ministry. I beg you, despite all my insistence, I am a elected minister, and I cannot walk behind the appointed officer. <p> For what I'm saying, I was very young, I was 34 years old, and at half past eight in the morning, he called a legendary name to the mountain like Ecevit, and he said: \"Mr. Doğan, I want to work with you in general management. I am a member of the group board, sir. I already work with you. I said, I want to work with you. I'm asking now: is there a minister in Turkey, including this period, who has been approved since Özal? Our friends are probably learning from television, mostly from radio news. <p> Do they know about the riots? I don't... <p> I say it in all humility, but it probably did, because the way it came, the way it came, it's not consensual. Now, if you'll be so kind, you'll have to live on mortgages. For that reason, when the mayors came to this office -- as Mr. Tayip said, as the President said -- who showed them? He showed me. Well, does he need to be brought down by his rights and law because he showed it to me, or should he be? No, not that either. Well, one word from these guys about the rights and laws of the people who voted 50,000, 100,000, 3 million, 5 million votes for them, my friend, I've come for five years, and if I have one crime, I want to be tried, I want to stay on this mission. Is there anyone to say anything? Don't think it's a provocation against Mr. Ki Tayyip; never think of it as an incentive to rebel against the mayors. You know why? The name of this move may well be the Purge, or the name of this move may be the regeneration, or the name of this move may be the new tiles on the road to success in 2019. Any excuse can be said, but the status of these friends is now at a much lower level than the <PARTY> mayors. <p> What is it? Today, all <PARTY> mayors have been dismissed by trustees -- there are those in prison, there are those out there -- at least all of these are suspended mayors. What is the status of our friends who have been resigned or resigned from this mission? And then there's their explanation, which is interesting: no one can stop me from being loyal to my party. He doesn't want you near them with your ball and your rifle, and if you're a fire after you're gone, you'll burn as much ground as dirt, what's the point? What's the point? <p> For what I'm saying is that there's a delicacy in politics, a person's personality, a person's personality, a party's personality is very important, of course, and dignity is important, but we have family, we have children, we have relatives, we have salutable people, what do I have to do with my honor? If this honor is no more than the weight of accountability, then this is how you surrender, that's one. <p> Two, I'd like to tell your group about my personal complaint. You don't treat us like MPs, you don't rule us, your government doesn't treat us like MPs. We can't use our constitutional rights. I can't go visit a friend in prison without permission from the Minister of Justice. Yeah, well, that's humane, so we'll look at it face-to-face tomorrow. You didn't come to me on my most difficult day. How am I supposed to face the man who says, We're going to have to get permission, and it's not allowed. <p> Ahmet Yıldırım told us yesterday that we are overwhelmed by the greetings of our friends in the prison where <PARTY> MP friends have brought us and visited us. <PARTY> MP, he's leaving whenever he wants, MP <PARTY> goes if he wants, the AK PARTI MP can visit any prison he wants, but if you're <PARTY> MP, you're on leave. <p> I'll tell you something else about myself, if you'll excuse me, I beg your pardon, but there isn't much time left. There are very valuable mayors in Turkey, Osman Kakuncu is the Mayor of Kayseri, Nalçacı is the Mayor of Kolya. They've been called diamonds for years. <p> It's not nice to flatter myself, but I left a brand city. I don't have a fortune, friends. I'm not the rich mayor. I'm saying every penny of this, the 32 inspectors brought in, after winning the mayoral office of the AK PARTI, and after being Minister of Abdulkadir Aksu, I'm saying it with the result of a thorough investigation by 10 inspectors for three years. I didn't touch the Beytulmah, and I'm on it, and I'm on it. But I tried to leave a great city. In fact, it was my greatest prize: When I went to Kayseri, where did you come from? They said you have Celal Doğan. They said, I went to Denizli, wherever I went, you have Celal Doğan. The citizens told me. My identity with the city has become my greatest fortune. In the meantime, I thank God I was able to win that title. But I left a great city, a city with squares. Show me a mayor who has a challenge of 100,000 people. I just left an 11km park in the city, right and left, around the sewers in a city. It wasn't enough, I left a 191 million-foot zoo in the city. I've left four organized industries, one trading center. When I left, Gaziantep's head, or rather, exports were up to $7 billion, and the city was planned according to 2040. But perhaps the arrival of 450, or even 600,000 daily, of our Syrian brothers, has changed their plans. But with its infrastructure and its superstructure, I've worked every inch, every word of the Metropolitan City Law that's being implemented today. <p> I stayed at the Patalya Hotel with the President for seven days. It's an excellent law, but the mayors... don't they lack the perfect law? I do. It has to be fixed. I think you'll probably bring a change. With the authority and resources you give when we're done with those flaws, the mayors are the prime minister of his district if they're hardworking. They're skilled enough to compete in their cities, so they'll appreciate it. <p> Sir, services may fail in some of the cities. Why? The mayor must fall in love with his city, treat it like a child. How, or rather, how your children flourish in your hands, the mayor, who falls in love with the city, flourishes and expands it. <p> I find our President's latest statement is justified by his complaints about Istanbul, Ankara, especially from the vantage point or from the skyline point of view. A mayor, such as Mr. Özhaseki, has no right to interrupt his self-responsibility just to send a message elsewhere, when there are at least some mayors who would like to learn from him. <p> So -- maybe I did, but -- let me finish with this... <p> (mixophone turned off by automatic device). <p> It's nice to be mayor. <p> It's much better to leave with honor. <p> Thank you, I'm paying my respects.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, members of lawmakers, this is all about violence. I hope there's no one among us who doesn't know the significance of that word. Let's go to the 1800s: Padişah II. Abdulhamit took some very important steps to improve microbiology, and you know what he did? He gave a man like Pasteur the Order of Mecidiye so that he could learn how to make vaccines, and at that time, he tricked the three of our citizens into buying 200 houses in Istanbul, and gave them to raise them as assistants. So, thanks to this team, the first diphtheria serum started being produced at that time. The first Ottoman state in the world to be established was the world's third rabies museum, and the first state in the world to make laws to implement a smallpox vaccine. <p> The 1900s, where we had world wars, were undoubtedly the years when the plague killed more people. Dr. Rashid Reza and Dr. Tefik Salim found the typhoid vaccine in those difficult conditions, and Dr. Refik Saydam prepared this vaccine and moved on to the world literature. Here we are, children of a nation that has founded the Institute for the exact nature of Dr. Refik Saydam Hhizzizah. In those years, Mustafa Hilmi Bey had vaccinated in a bottle of boza at Gedikpaşa bath, and we sold 220,000 doses to the British and the French even during the occupation of Istanbul. <p> We have arrived in 1923: With the formation of the Republic, important steps have been taken in our country regarding the vaccine. On behalf of Refik Saydam, the Institute of Ataturk was founded in 1928, and according to the law, the 1267. As we always talk about nationalism, in those days, when nationalism was understood correctly, the purpose of the HN wasn't just to produce vaccines and serums, but also to oversee external vaccines and medications. It didn't take long to reach the targets, and four years later, that huge Hüfzýsshih had ended its dependence on the outside with the production of vaccines. What happened was after the 2000s. In particular, he was prevented from performing his public function, and then gradually the production of vaccines was terminated. After that, the institution slowly became dependent on the outside, and eventually, in 2011, the door of KHK No. 663 was locked on the door of Huffzishah. Well, that's the story of the MILF. <p> I'll give you some numbers. It's finished, but of course life goes on, and viruses continue to breed and destroy people with a virus like Covid-19. As of now, it costs $40 million to build an institute like HM from scratch, so that's $260 million. Do you know how much we pay for the vaccine the Health Department imports every year? We're paying $13 million. Here, with the total of $13 million given for three years, a perfect Institute for Influence can be re-enacted. <p> Thank you. <p> We spent $40 billion on Syrian refugees, which means we can build a thousand science centers. You see, if we had had the HD, we wouldn't have been dependent on the vaccine, we wouldn't have expected drugs and vaccines from outside countries, like swine flu, bird flu. It's time to think while there's no virus that's targeted our brain functions yet, while it's not forbidden to think. Who and who made us depend on the outside? <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the <PARTY> Group on Article 12 of the 2020 Central Management Budget Law Proposal. I salute the General Assembly and our beloved nation, who are watching us at the beginning of their screens. <p> Respected lawmakers, today the global financial order is still trying to be shaped in the interests of sovereign forces. In this context, the Turkish economy has been under siege and attack for a long time. International economic assassins, capital extortionists, international companies and banks are involved in this economic operation. At this point, however, Turkey rules out these treacherous attacks by the strong union of the Cumhur Alliance, with hard money and finance policies. As a matter of fact, macroeconomic figures show that serious recovery is at stake. The most remarkable improvement here is interest rates. As interest rates go down, the investment climate will become even more spectacular and the recovery will appear like a day. One of the main, most basic tasks of the Cumhur Alliance is to provide it. <p> A recent report on the future of the Turkish economy estimates that food and drink, agricultural AR-Ge and services, alternative energy, automobile production and tourism will come first in Turkey until 2041. Thus, with multi-directional industrialisation strategies and sectoral dynamic analysis, it is possible to say that Turkey's economy will increase its share and importance in the world economy. This is the only way that Turkey's political position and reputation in its particular region will be raised. As the National Movement Party, I would especially like to point out that there should be more emphasis on production, lowering tax loads on employment, controlling agricultural dissolution, not only transferring resources to the construction sector, but an effort to specialise technology in terms of high-profit products. Because otherwise, neither the unemployment rate in double digits, nor the revenue distribution imbalance, nor the success that is wanted and targeted in combating poverty will be achieved. <p> Dear lawmakers, I would like to address some of the important needs and demands of my constituency district, Kırıkkale, during the central management budget talks in 2020. In the middle of Central Anatolia, Kırıkkale is a province that has sacrificed everything for its state, but is not satisfied with the state's expectations. For a long time, our cravale complains that there has been no improvement in business and new investments. Planned to develop on three main chords today, Cırıkkale is hungry and thirsty for investment in agriculture, tourism, industry and especially defence industry. In this regard, we ask the government's authorities once again to take care and care of both public and private investments. <p> Dear MPs, Kırıkkale, despite being part of the 4th district incentive system, are one of our districts within the provinces of TR71 and one of our cities that receive the least share of encouraged investments across the country. In this regard, investment appeal should be created, and the demands of our people should be taken into account, taking advantage of the incentives of the Bürıkkale, the 6th district. <p> Although 3 OSBs have been found, the proportion of the filling is still very inadequate. As such, the planned level of employment cannot be achieved. In particular, the Armed Development OSB is a chance for the Brokenkale, but it needs more attention from the Defence Industry Presidency, which is among its partners. Therefore, I'd like to say that we are waiting as Brokenboners from our ministries for special incentives and support that will give the OSB an advantage. On the other hand, the operation of the Kırıkkale Karma Industries region must be accelerated and must be launched immediately. <p> Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, investments that have been reduced and inadequate in Kırıkkale are also fueling unemployment. According to data, unemployment has reached 12 per cent in Çırıkkale, while at a young age it has reached 22 per cent. Our young brothers and sisters who spend time in tea stoves tell us on every occasion that they are unable to make plans for the future because of unemployment. So we shouldn't be tied down, we should be able to open the way for new investments that will create jobs for them to dream about. In this regard, a comprehensive promotion plan designed and carried out to promote the Kırkkale as a whole, with its goals, its goals, its goals, and its strategy must be carried out immediately. Investments planned by the oil and products sector must be brought to our province with special incentives, considering the activities of <PARTY>RAS and PETKIM (PETKIM) in Kırkkale. Investment support should not only remain in the initial phase, it should vary greatly until the marketing of products. <p> In agriculture, high input costs are lowering our farmer's income, our peasant's income, and they can barely make the next year's planting happen. In order to exhale our broken-cased farmer and peasant, we need to be able to forgive their interest debt and go to a configuration of other electricity and water debts. Again, the fertilizer prices that our agricultural Credit Co-operatives are selling to our farmer are very high; the work needed to get down to reasonable levels must be started immediately. <p> The cleftkale is a rich province of mineral diversity. These mineral deposits are concentrated in the districts of Delica, Keskin, Çelebi and Balisheh. It is a huge necessity for the Mining Study and Search General Directorate to begin its operation and bring these mines into Turkey's economy as soon as possible in terms of bringing its current underground resources into the economy. <p> Again, it is also needed to invest and promote in this area, which is rich in medical and aromatic plants. <p> Mr. President, the esteemed MPs, Cırıkkale, are our retired city. In order for the economic situation of our pensioners to improve quickly, the necessary steps must be taken and must be made to ensure that the pensioner is out of the system. <p> Our tradesmen and artists' tax and, again, the premium burden must be lightened; we must restructure their debt and forgive some of it. <p> Again, for our intensively animal-based manufacturer, the Brokenkale must first be given a modern meat combination, and we must provide support and necessary conveniences in areas such as veterinary, bait, medicine, and livestock. <p> Respected lawmakers are the lowest financial and social rights institution of the Machine and Chemical Industry Agency among the state-owned institutions we today call KIT. Primarily, this inequality between the OSCE must be resolved and our workers who work in factories can be met with righteous demands and expectations. <p> In order to move Machine and Chemical Industries to a high-tech high-tech production model, investment efforts must be accelerated, while modernisation of existing facilities must be carried out immediately. For machine and chemistry to open to new markets internationally and to reach higher sales figures, they must be able to do whatever they can to create new production sites by sharing in defence projects in different countries. <p> Minister, I've just asked you as a question from my position, but I don't think the answer has come to you yet. The municipality of Kurıkkale has been purified in our city centre, but since there is no purification of our municipalities, wastewaters are being released to Kızılırmak. I would like you to show the proper sensitivity in this matter, and on behalf of my fellow citizens, I'd like you to make a special request. This is also extremely important in terms of environmental pollution. <p> Again, we are aware of the projects your Ministry of Environment has done for our Cırıkkale. And I, again, thank you, as Congresswoman of the Kırıkkale, and all the bureaucrats from here. <p> Honourable MPs, with these thoughts, I salute the General Assembly, asking that the central management budget of 2020 bring blessings to our country, our state and our nation.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of the AK PARTY Group on the <PARTY> group proposal. I salute you all. <p> Just as our EC PARTY has been increasing the welfare level of all our communities since the first day of power, one of the major steps in this area is to improve living standards, one of our achievements is to our elders, our pensioners. Prior to the AK PARTI power, those scenes, which were a huge challenge in the queues of wages, took significant steps in order of hospitals, in order of medicine, to see the respect and respect that our precious elders deserve, and, praise be to God, are far behind. The EC PARTI was reduced to a minimum in previous times, with the arrangements between minimum pension and minimum wage. The labour-employee pension ended during our AK PARTY. With reforms in social security, pensioners, such as the USSR, BUG-KUR and Retirement Chest, combined under social security, the differences were eliminated. After retirement, the social benefits bonus of 10 per cent of our pensioners, who were doing their job, who wanted to continue working, was removed. This ordeal has been put to rest for our pensioners who have been able to go to hospitals, according to the institutions they have retired to before. College hospitals and private hospitals have been granted a non-transmittance application; health-responsibility has been terminated; medications have been facilitated; world standards, such as home care services, have been implemented. KEY got them to take advantage of their refunds. Again, our pensioners are being paid extra by removing the receipt, which is a major inconvenience. The opportunity for public transportation over 65 years of age has been granted. At Ramadan and Victim's Holidays, our pensions were given bonuses, and bank promotions contributed to our pensions again. Our elders, who retired before 2000, had their attitude problems solved by our AK PARTY. <p> TOKI's quota has been divided into pensions, allowing our pensions to be housed in very low installments, and the 65-year-old pension has been cut out of symbolicism. Those of our elders who could not retire because of their bonus debts were able to pay their debts by paying their debts with the Agriculture Bank, allowing them to retire, providing state support for complementary pension programmes to ensure that they receive a second income during the retirement period. In addition to continuing employment, the disability pension was not cut out, but received a two-month pension, allowing him to retire as well as his later work. Of course, is that enough? It's not enough. By the direction of our president, as of January, I would like to say that our work is being carried out in order to improve the revenues of our pensions, and I salute you all.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, members of lawmakers, I have taken a pledge on behalf of the National Movement Party Group regarding Bill 524, and I salute the General Assembly and the beloved Turkish nation. <p> At the beginning of my speech, I call upon the court of Genab to join and assist our heroic soldiers who are fighting for the safety and peace of the Turkish nation. To all our martyrs who have lost their lives for the sake of the land, the nation and the sanctity, I pray to God, to our veterans and to our beloved nation. <p> I also bless our brothers and sisters who were brutally martyred 26 years ago by the Armenians as a result of the genocide in Karabakh. We haven't forgotten the teacher massacre, and we'll never forget it. <p> I also wish you the best of luck to all civil defense specialists in public institutions and organizations that provide protective security, disaster and emergency services with a superior sense of duty, as it is tomorrow's Civil Defense Day to be understood. <p> Dear lawmakers, we all know that improving the investment climate is closely related to the quality of the judicial system, the speed and the enforcement of contracts. Because of the close relationship of economic and legal fields with each other, it is also inevitable that an efficient and predictable legal system exists so that the investment environment can be improved. Because no matter how positive the economic incentives for investment environment are, the lack of legal security in the country and a predictable environment for legal processes in the country is a deterrent for investors. <p> As the National Movement Party, our election statement states that the legal measures for further investments and production will be taken along with economic measures on administrative processing and accelerating the judicial process. <p> The draft law provides a comprehensive provision of provisions for the removal of the institution of the bankruptcy and the revision of the concordato institution and the extension of the scope of the electronic notification obligation. The most important change is, without a doubt, the suspension of the bankruptcy institution. <p> We consider it a need to make some changes in Article 2004, which have been in effect since 1932, which has been under way since 1932, in accordance with the developments in business life, and under measures to improve the investment climate. The bill aims to abolish bankruptcy and strengthen the concordato institution, thereby protecting the debtor's rights and the creditors' rights through a system involving creditors in the process. At the same time, it is possible for the debtor to pay the debt easily, with the arrangements being made to ensure the continuation of production. <p> On the other hand, during the concordato, the search for execution is being halted for the debtor's efforts to pay off his debts. There may be a measure of resolving failures in the process of postponing bankruptcy, allowing the Concordato institution to function. The important thing here is that there is no opportunity for abuse in both debtors and creditors and the protection of the rights of both parties. In the draft, changes to the agreements of the creditors after a negotiation with the debtor and to the use of the concordato institution based on the court's approval could also solve some problems that have a negative impact on business and social life. <p> As the National Movement Party, our proposals for amendments to certain provisions of the bill to contribute to improving the investment climate have been largely met with changes made in the lower commission and the main commission. However, we think it would be helpful to revisit some issues in the bill. In this framework, it is envisioned to convert property and rights, which are considered to be a wholeer income if it is sold as a whole or if it is sold as a whole, but especially if there is a commercial and economic integrity between independent parts of non-moving goods, or if there is a limited rights, such as the rights of altitude, it may be a problem to convert money in a whole form, and it may be a violation of the interests of third people who have been set up in favour of the list of contractors. <p> The bill stipulates that the debtor will be granted a one-year deadline if the concordaton is able to achieve success and that in special situations that are difficult, the deadline can be extended for up to six months. Although intermediary reports will be submitted during a given year's final deadline, reassigning a one-year period to the dynamic of trade life may pose a problem. Because in cases when there is no hope of recovery, the debtor will be eligible for immediate bankruptcy and protection of the rights of the creditors. <p> The bill did not extend any limitation in terms of creditors when the exact deadline was to be adjusted to contracts. However, it would be appropriate to limit the impact of the deadline on contracts to creditors affected by the concordato. <p> The appointment of a project supervisor to ensure the completion of the concordaton is also expected to be appointed as a trustee for surveillance, management and liquidation measures, but since the situation is related to restructuring, we assess that it would be appropriate to be appointed as a project supervisor to ensure the completion of the approved concordate, and if there is a trustee appointment, then the trustee's duties, authority and responsibilities will be determined in a clear manner. <p> On the other hand, given the importance of the function of the concordato commissioner, it would be wise to point to the regulation that its administrative position, authority and responsibilities, along with its qualifications, will be made clear. <p> The bill also includes arrangements for the swifter resolution of trade discrepancies. <p> An important part of the discrepancies involved in the investigation trial stemming from trade discrepancies, while the court's jurisdiction and authority may have a problem. The obvious determination of the court, which is in charge of the bill, will also eliminate the negative effects from prosecution trials. However, when another special court, other than the original trade court, has applied for a conflict in the field of duty, it is possible that while the residency court is present, the main court of law will be able to create a separate argument. <p> The bill also envisions that electronic notifications will be carried out through the National Electronic Reporting System, which was established and run by the Post and Telegraph Agency while the scope of the necessary electronic notifications is expanded. For the sake of this critical service, PTT will have to take all measures to ensure the safety of the system and the preservation of the data recorded in this system. However, the PTT (PTT) that conducts electronic notifications is not required to allow sub-employees to see some of this work or all of it over time. Otherwise, as stated in the context of this work, PTT will be excluded from the principle of meeting, bringing security problems with it. Therefore, we consider it appropriate to include the ruling that the notifications will be conducted directly by the PTT. <p> On the other hand, considering the prevalence situation of the Internet, the speed of the internet, local partial setbacks and possible cuts due to service providers, it would also be appropriate to review the required scope of the electronic notification. <p> As a result, we assess that the bill will contribute to the removal of obstacles to investments, while the system will function in a healthier way in the case of resolving remembered shortcomings. <p> With these thoughts, I ask that the bill bring good results to our country and our nation, and I salute you worthy members of the General Assembly.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, dear MPs, I salute the General Assembly. <p> We're negotiating various international agreements, and there are certain issues that we agree on, but there are contracts that we object to. I'd like to talk about it briefly. For once, I would like to say a few words about this agreement with Guinea, or a contract with Guinea. <p> There is a familiar head of state in Guinea, where only one man is in power and Alpha Conde has been running the country since 2010. In particular, many people have been killed or injured, led by Alpha Conde, during protests in Guinea after 2010. Prior to the 2013 elections, nine civilians were killed and hundreds were injured as security forces intervened in protestors demanding transparency in the elections. This conflict also led to a conflict between the two largest ethnic groups of the country, the peoples of Fulani and Malinke. According to the laws of Guinea, a person, a head of state, can only be elected twice in a row, but Alpha Conde did not find it enough and is trying to go to the amendment to run for the third time in the elections in 2020. But in October of last year, the public went out to protest it, and again, with orders from the head of state to law enforcement, dozens of people lost their lives and were injured, and more than 100 others were taken into custody in the conflict. <p> Reports published by international right-based organisations have included the violence used against the people of the state of Guinea. The Human Rights Watch has said that the government has been actively trying to prevent opposition by banning all demonstrations since July 2018, and therefore the United Nations must ask the government of Guinea to secure basic rights in the elections in 2020. In the 2017-2018 Guinea Rights Violation Report of Amnesty International, the government reportedly arrested opposition journalists and activists in an arbitrary manner. <p> Eighty-five percent of Guinea, where freedom of expression violations are committed in an intense way, are composed of very different religious representations, people, including Muslims, and Christians, the majority of the remaining population. <p> Again, one of the violations made by many right-based organisations about Guinea is violence against women. Almost 95 percent of women are forced into this practice in Guinea, the most dense country of women's circumcision in the world. This violence is not only intended for Muslim women, but for women in all religious areas that are there. <p> As a result, we believe that military agreements with the head of state in Guinea, which insists to remain in power despite the high objections of the people, will neither benefit the people of Guinea nor help the democratic development of that country. Therefore, I would like to express that we do not approve of this military agreement with the government of Guinea, which is not hesitant to use real bullets against its own people. <p> Dear friends, after stating this issue, I'd like to say a few words about the Canal Istanbul Project, which is being held as Istanbul MP in İstanbul. For one thing, we know that in democratic countries, such projects, whatever you say, we will do it. With such stubbornness, with ambition, with hatred, with anger, they will not be expressed. If the government believes that this project is true or believes that any project is correct, the reasons for this project, why it is necessary, how it is useful, in detail, how it is useful, by its style, by its state administration, in line with its responsibility, and it tries to convince the public of some of the objections the opposition has offered, and try to convince the public of its impropriety. But how does that work for us? I'll do what we call power poisoning, a monopoly on power, a state's ability to collect all its devices in its own hands. Whatever you say, we'll do it. It's based on politics. This shows that, in fact, the <PARTY>'s power, the current government, is able to create itself through polarisation and camping politics, so it sees polarization, campinging, dividing certain parts of the population in terms of the continuation of its own power. Now, we know that, on the one hand, the <PARTY>'s power, which they're defending, has actually sat down, and the system called changed is no longer working, so even though it's new, it's not working, and there's no way that this system can go on like this, and there's no way that power can go on like this. Because of this, especially some of the construction companies that they themselves feed themselves -- you know, there's a group of people -- who, you know, sometimes curse, insult the public -- that's reflected in the press -- this gang, these supporters, and some of the communities that they support, the foundations, the associations that need to be supported by showing this cake, so that you can walk this policy of holding it together. Otherwise, they see for themselves that there is no way to maintain that power under normal circumstances. In this sense, the Canal Istanbul Project is being discussed through a runt of politics. Of course, we, environmental organisations, ecology organizations, economists have objections, and these objections are not indiscriminate objections, and they must be evaluated in a significant way, and the project must be addressed in that sense. Let me try to sum up some of this. <p> In particular, the combination of the Black Sea's cold and fresh water and the Mediterranean's hot and salty water reaching Marmara, and from there to the Black Sea, says that the sea will upset the balance of salt, water, and life, scientists say. As oxygen runs out in the lower waters of the Marmara Sea, the hydrogen sulphide density in the lower layer will fly, which means that there's a high probability of leaving the entire Istanbul to smell like rotten eggs, scientists are talking about. They're talking about the height of the possibility of subterranean reservoirs being filled with sea water from open channels. It is said that all countries on the shore of the Black Sea will have an interaction that will affect their nature. <p> The project will include the destruction of about 20,000 football fields of natural forest. The forest, as you know, is an ecosystem, and it's not a forest by planting trees, it's an ecosystem that you can't provide. <p> The project will cause irreversible ecological damage in the city and the region. <p> The project was later applied to the city's top-sized plan, and the plan contradicts its main decisions. <p> There are three active fault lines on the project route, which involve earthquakes and tsunamis. <p> With the project, the entire population will be inverted in employment balance. <p> There is a high risk of landslides and liquefies due to the canal. <p> Locals who provide for their livelihoods from agriculture and livestock will lose the guarantee of their lives; because of the nationalization of most of them, the seizure, they will have to work as workers in this land. Even though they have employed themselves and are now contributing to the country's agriculture and animalism, they will all become workers in many areas, in the region, and we have witnessed them in the project. <p> The network seems to cause irreparable problems due to production, operating costs, and payback imbalances, my friends. <p> In that sense, dear friends, it is imperative that these objections be taken into account and that this project must be completely and completely annulled. <p> And finally, one of the things that I've expressed every time I've been on this stand is that the power of Diyarbakır Cemevi is still out. We've heard a lot of brotherly talks on this stand, we've heard sisterly literature, but the power of a temple is out, causing religious services and funeral services there to fail. The problem is still not solved. Despite the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, this problem has been unresolved despite decisions made by the State. And they're about to face similar problems in my electoral district, in Istanbul's Esenyurt, at the Eren Education Cultural Foundation Cemevi, because despite the case, the electricity bill is still being cut. <p> I'm ending it, Mr. President. <p> Court decisions are being made, yet no one recognizes the court's verdicts, and this practice continues. <p> So once again, instead of speaking from these platforms, from these areas, we need to do what we need to do, instead of speaking from what we are, and speaking from what we are doing, and speaking from what we are doing, we need to do what we need to do. From those who make many brotherly literature from these platforms, those who call themselves our brothers and sisters, we demand and expect that they do so. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I'm going to try to express our views on the Constitutional Law Proposal for Changes in Some Laws by the Cooperatives Act 283 rows. <p> Now, let me give you a co-op first, and then let's consider together how useful this offer will be to treat the distortions, to treat the complexity of this cooperative. <p> Farm Credit Co-operatives... Fahrettin Poyraz is the general manager of these cooperatives. Now, these cooperatives are run by a bureaucratic elite. I asked him, and I said, \"Ya, you're getting $180,000 from 11 places.\" He didn't answer. And then he came out and made these allegations, but that's not true, I actually get 62,500 lira. He said, \"We're relieved that it's happening.\" This is Bereket Insurance, which is part of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives, sponsored the Umraniyespor, which is the most expensive sponsorship, as well as the name. Now, one asks whether it's co-op or not: could it be this kind of co-operativeism? I mean, spending money collected or sponsored by a sports club from public resources is in the mentality of what cooperatives, and how does that still go on in a current way? Again, I asked a friend of his own who sold 30 to 40 percent cheaper pesticides, and they said everything that was done was in accordance with the law. Last year, I asked him why he imported the meat from the local manufacturer -- again, the subsidiary of the Agriculture Loan -- from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to 45 lira. Everything that was done was done according to the rule of law. There was an answer. <p> Now, as a congressman, I can't control a co-op, which is one of the most important duties of an MP. How can this proposal claim to oversee such a cooperative? How can the partners of this cooperative control this cooperative? <p> Friends, co-op has been at an extraordinary impasse for quite some time. For one thing, the purpose of the commercial company is profit, the means are capital, but cooperatives basically work according to the principles of solidarity, cooperation and bail to ensure the economic and social development of their partners. If we think of co-ops as a commercial company, we've already done it wrong from the start, we've got the wrong button. <p> I think it's better to go back a little bit. The origins of co-ops are not precapitalistic, as they say. So the guilds and other trade organizations, yes, have established some solidarity relations, a sense of purpose, but basically the emergence of cooperatives is capitalism. Why is that? Because feudalism was the center of the country, and the people who were in the country began to migrate from country to city intensively, as the cities were then the center, as capitalism developed. As a result of this intense migration, they felt the need to rub their backs against each other in solidarity in order to avoid the usual inequality created by capitalism. So, in the early 1800s, the origin of the cooperatives dating up to 1850 was shaped by this antiquitiestist mentality, and in a way from that time, good and bad continues. I assure you, when we look at it from this perspective, we can't speak of a co-operative experience in Turkey, which is built on its own internal dynamics, at the request of the people. <p> Look, Mithat Pasha is being given an example. Mithat Pasha is an Ottoman ambassador, isn't he? So, Mithat Pasha and the Arks of the Homeland are established because they approve of the service. Let's go a little further to the republic. The co-operatives established in the Republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk are not, as we know them, the initiative and demand of the base. So, in our country -- and I'm sorry to say -- the majority of co-ops came from the bureaucratic elite, which is what the executives see as a model of development, which is a tool for the development of the country. Is it bad? No, it's not bad, but if this is a co-op we're discussing, it's better to take it a step further. What if this has become such a matter that my dear friends, the governor of Ankara, Nevzat Tandoğan of the era, have a saying that if communism comes to this country, we will bring it to it. For this reason, co-operativeism in Turkey has always been made by state guardianship; it has almost never been co-operative experience, self-determination, self-determination, autonomy, and practical implementation of these decisions. Do you know why I say almost? At one point, some cooperatives came forward, one of which was CSU-KOOP. KCY-KOOP, in fact, is a village development co-op model, reaching hundreds of thousands of members by the coup of September 12, 1980. September 12th military coup has shut down this cooperative. It has been so successful that in the field, for example, it has also had a lot of benefits in agriculture in terms of mechanization by bringing a tractor from Romania and selling the tractor it brings directly from Romania to the village. But does he have bureaucratic control mechanisms? There is. Did the government see the co-ops in him as a potential communist nest, especially the CSU-KOOP? Yes, he did. This is why the military dictatorship of September 12th has brought trouble to all cooperatives in Turkey. With January 24th Decisions -- September 12th opened its path, it will be known -- the neoliberism that entered the country was originally formed on a floor like this. Why am I saying this? Because co-operative is about cooperation, solidarity, bail, which is about telling people that you're not alone in this world, that you're suggesting that people should come together, that you're giving birth to unity, but if neoliberism is going to enter the country, if there's going to be a capital-based business here, of course, and of course that kind of organization doesn't want capital. Similar things have happened in Europe at the birth of capitalism. Capital organisations have always been an obstacle to the development of workers' cooperatives. Unfortunately, in our country, we've suffered a lot from co-operativeism, a lot from which the state constantly oversees from above, an ongoing intervention, a decision led by its own government commissioners, to which decision to make, and we've suffered a lot. <p> Now, let's ask the question together: Why, let's take it from Mithat Pasha, and from Mithat Pasha until now, has not been a cooperative in this country, brother? Why didn't this happen? No. Because we're not looking at cooperatives with a public perspective. So, this proposal of the law, by overseeing the co-ops more, by building something called external control, in fact, the fact that cooperatives will live on their own internal dynamics, dynamics, decision-making processes, organizations that will stand on their feet, structures. He probably picked it up and threw it in the trash can, so to speak. I'm not just saying it's a proposal, but it's been pretty much the case with all the offers so far, dear friends. <p> Now, he's always trying to tell us: \"Ya, you're always critical; criticism, criticism, criticism, and you don't like anything. Well, you put something in the middle, and we'll look at it. We put it up, we wrote a 90-point co-op proposal last year. We've sent this proposal to all of our political parties here, and even those who are not. Now, the basic issue we see is this is a technical arrangement, an offer is a technical arrangement. We say that no cooperative law that does radical changes and transformations in the philosophy of co-operativeism is going to be practical. Therefore, certainly, and certainly, the mechanisms for co-ops to be institutionalized, such as cooperation, solidarity, and bail, but above all, that cooperative co-operative partners will run it. So it's really about democratization of the state. Not just the democratisation of the internal legislation of the cooperative, but the democratization of the universe around the cooperative can only be achieved. <p> And yet, technically, we've drawn up suggestions on what needs to be done. In our proposal, we once say: \"This is the structural change, to transform, there are three laws: the Law of Cooperatives No. 1163, the Law of Agriculture Loan Cooperatives and Unions 1581, Law on Agriculture Sales Cooperatives and Associations 4572.\" I can't do this. So if three poor villagers get together and say, let's build a cooperative, there's no way we can get out of these laws. Law number 1163, you're looking at the basic law, and if you're going to build something else, you're taking advantage of other laws. This has to be a one-way street. With our proposal of the law, our claim is in the same way that we've singled out these laws. <p> Second, three ministries oversee this area. No, these three ministries need to be replaced by a co-operative ministry, dear friends. Like the Agriculture Bank, banks that no longer lend $750 million to capital and don't even look at it can't solve the debt problem, this Agriculture Loan can't solve the loan problem, so a cooperative bank needs to be set up. This proposal for the Ministry of Co-operatives sounds very surprising; there was, you know, there was, if I remember correctly, that ministry was already established in Turkey, until it was shut down. <p> In order for co-operatives to become democratic, the board, like those in charge of the representation, the things that have replaced that bureaucratic mean even more have to be replaced by democratic mechanisms such as the general council, the cooperatives' council, the executive board. <p> There's another thing called peace. These processes, which corporateise the co-ops there, leave their decision-making processes to the initiative of a ruling elite, must be eliminated. Instead of the right of peace in co-operatives, the union must go to charge, provided it is not above minimum wage, and is subject to a decision made by the co-op general board. <p> And a freak is this inter-partner activity. It's said, brother, that you produce milk, it's cooperative activity, but if you make cheese, I'll burn your cherry. Do you know why it burns my cherry? Then he breaks down and collects taxes from me because he's engaged in commercial activity. That's why co-ops can't develop, so there's no way to raise capital. <p> Dear friends, small and medium-scale cooperatives are our suggestion. What we refer to as this cooperative activity, we need to remove what you describe as inter-ortal activity. This is necessary for the development of small and medium-scale cooperatives. The one who manufactures the tomato -- what, you give it out of your pocket -- builds tomato sauce, builds a small factory there, sells tomato sauce, helps your co-op. <p> We're here for the outside inspection. The co-op has internal auditors, the general board is elected; the senior union has co-op control, it has judicial control, but the rulings are not satisfied with it, and they say: \"We also have an external control. Who is in it?\" By God, everyone from the ministry to the financial advisors. No way, friends, you've already fallen into the community of co-ops; it's already left bureaucratic structure, state custody, cooperatives breathless, and there's no practical meaning or response to setting up another control mechanism on top of that. <p> Another problem: the main contract remains in question, there is no proper reference to the principal contract, and there is no proper reference here. So once again, we need to remember that the main contract is the aorta of the co-op, the blood is the life, and the main issues have to be settled by the principal contract. <p> I think it's very dangerous: the upper limit of a share of a partner's commitment to loan co-ops has been removed; it doesn't match the co-op philosophy once, it's wrong. It's a certain amount; if not a certain amount comes from a rich person, okay, when everyone gets a share, he gets 50 shares, and then he turns that cooperative into an instrument of his own profit; it's something that has nothing to do with cooperative philosophy, dear friends. That's why only real people should be members of the co-operatives, that's why they should be partners. The reason that non-real individuals, the legal personalities, the municipalities, share in co-ops -- I mean commercial companies in particular -- is profit, you have to avoid that. When you put a corporate personality in there, when you bring in a commercial company, all the decisions that that cooperative will make will be for profit, not solidarity, cooperation, bail. Let's continue... we've written all of this on our proposal for the law, but it's not considered too valuable in the spoils of power; we gave it to them as well. <p> Again, there's one other problem, and this 26th article was brought in later, so at first it didn't exist: agricultural sales co-ops and non-independent agricultural sales co-ops are exempted from Turkish Trade Law 6102. Well, if we're going to exempt something from taxes, there's poor, small, village development co-ops, there's poor cooperatives, let's keep them tax-free. But there is a good chance that the president's sales co-op should be established in the last few days. We see the continuation of his idea here. They will be granted tax exemptions, tax exceptions, and naturally they will be allowed to continue their activities in a tax-free environment, which is never, ever right. The failure of the economic crisis is not possible to correct people's poverty, their lack of access to food, by law enforcement or by making-up methods, precious friends. <p> Here's another thing: education. So we wrote it, yes, the education issue is a big deal, but it's not the board members, it's not the inspectors. They should be given proper public co-op training. We recommend that co-operative universities should be established, friends, and these cooperative universities should be widely educated, and agriculture and co-op courses from the very first course should certainly and certainly go into the curriculum. We had it when we were kids, you'll remember, we had an agricultural book printed on yellow paper, we learned a lot. Now the children think that tomatoes grow in chain markets, and we've been pulled out of the ground by the right-wing powers, unfortunately. <p> Again, the person who is on a board of directors is not on another board -- we don't, of course -- we don't call it governance, it's the name of our proposal -- that's not the name of it. Everyone does one job. <p> Again, you have to give tax exceptions to small-scale rural development co-ops, agricultural sales co-ops, women's under 30-year-olds, cooperatives founded and disabled. The proposal was described as: \"The majority of them are women and the disabled ones are women. \" There's a problem with that: it's something that can be easily exploited. And there's no mention of tax exceptions, and there's talk of forgiveness for certain bureaucratic jobs. On the contrary, here, for a solid tax exception -- for small and medium-scale cooperatives, I say for village development co-ops -- we think it's absolutely necessary. <p> Another issue is about membership in the higher forces; it's really a big problem. In order to become a member of the higher forces, you have to motivate cooperatives, encourage them, encourage them, but there's no practical response to doing this by not allowing them to use credit and input. You've suggested this, but you've made no proposal to democratize the union with the cooperative or the upper union -- whatever -- between them -- that if you don't become a member, I'll hurt you. You said -- I mean, I mean -- that's a democratically problematic approach. <p> When it comes to electronic editing, there's emphasis in various places, which, of course, is useful, but here's the thing: look, that's why these co-op partners, after a while, don't use their co-op space, they don't have solidarity, bail, cooperation, and that's a deterrent and alienating factor. I'd like to bring this to your attention, dear friends. <p> Now, let's hear it. There's actually a lot more to say, but it's a little short notice. Now, in our country, we need a co-op mentality, especially to prevent the decontamination of the countryside. Dear friends, we've been turning around and saying this for years, but it's not a technical arrangement; it has to be a political arrangement. It's the people's... <p> May I salute you? <p> This is especially for the strengthening of small and medium-sized rural co-ops, to survive, to feed people where they end up, and ultimately to create a solid society, based on the principles of cooperation, solidarity and bail. Otherwise, I'm afraid there's no way we can resolve this with such makeup measures, such displays. Therefore, I, for one, offer you the bill of law that we have written, the cooperatives, the law, once again, to your attention. Even though this bill is passed, the heart wants us to join forces with all parties to pass a democratic, social, publicist co-operative law. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Yes, thank you, Mr. President. <p> We propose that Turkish Armed Forces Staff Act 387, and amendments to some Laws, be removed from the text of the text of the 5th and 6th notes added to Article 5442 and Article 11 of the State Administration Law. <p> Actually, I'd like to connect this to the argument that just happened. The speaker spoke on behalf of <PARTY> a number of claims, and our <PARTY> MPs said these allegations were not true. Right here, after the debate, Erkan Akçay Bey said that such claims would not be fit for the army, which would be sorted out in discipline and judgment. But with this bill, with this bill, it's blocked. I mean, these allegations are going to remain admissible because they've been brought in with a full immunity. And it's not just the army, it's usually the army, the debate. <p> The article says this, adding rangers now to this offer: \"The activities of Turkish Armed Forces personnel as part of this joke, which are alleged to have been carried out by military service and duties, are considered military offenses. \"The immunity is being granted to anyone who meets the description of the scope of the public official and other civil servants outside of Turkish Armed Forces personnel. This immunity is so broad that it's more than the MPs. <p> Just a few months ago, lawmakers' immunity was lifted here. In which lawmakers have no immunity in the case of a criminal and severe criminal offense. <p> With this clause brought in, he will not apply for arrest, detention and arrest until a warrant is granted to investigate the individuals, even if it is strictly criminal, even if it is a felony. <p> Not only that, friends, remember, when we were discussing measures such as CMK changes in 2005, amendments to the judiciary, search, detention, arrest, we were arguing with so much jealousy that we wanted the prosecutor to be given powers by the judge, but by this law, the clause we asked to be removed from the office, the closed spaces in the workplace, or in order to provide life or property security for the person to be captured, but by the written order of the commanding officer of the authority. <p> Now, even prosecutors in Turkey don't have this authority at many points at this time, under the written order of this commanding officer. We're authorizing that. <p> So, at this point, why is the government bringing this at a time when they've succeeded in fighting terrorism, when the PKK has broken its back, says it's over? <p> For one thing, it's just as if it's been taken out for the purpose of fighting terrorism, it's made to look like it's been removed from a particular region of Turkey, but it's being used all over Turkey. <p> Other than that, he hints politically that instead of a peaceful and democratic solution, security policies, which are now being held, will continue further. <p> This means that ever since the operations began, the number of martyrs that have reached more than 500 will increase, such as Sur, Cizre, and the cities that have been destroyed will continue to be destroyed. There's a problem for him, too. <p> Either there's been a mistake here, or there's already been an immunity to the crimes predicted. No matter what is true, the House must return from this wrong. Remember that if the political climate in Turkey changes, it will not protect the laws brought in. Remember the arrest of Ilker Basbug. It was written in the Constitution that the Chief of Staff and the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be tried in the Supreme Court, but the judicial system did not recognise it, and he tried both the chiefs of forces and the Chief of Staff in an unauthorized, unlawful court. So, first of all, we need a perspective that again targets democratic and peaceful solutions. <p> Otherwise, these guards won't stop. None of us will know which officers to land on after the rangers. None of us can know where that authority will be used today. Perhaps it will be used in Istanbul, perhaps because of more peaceful demonstrations. Thus, it is necessary to remove these substances. When the government failed, it dropped the burning ball into the arms of the army. In particular, the army must oppose it. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have been promised to speak on behalf of our nationalist Action Party group on Article 9 of the 2022 Central Management Budget Law Proposal. I hereby salute the General Assembly. <p> Mr. President, our country has been run by the presidential government system for over three years. Our nation made up its mind in a referendum on April 16th, free of the weights of the parliamentary system and its moldy shackles. This choice, which we see as a turning point for the 21st century, has brought with it a process of rapid development and acceleration. Basically, this system is the Turkish-type presidential system. Following the adoption of the presidential government system, the most comprehensive management reform in the history of the Republic, a busy period of reform has begun and legislation on all institutions and institutions of our state is being revised according to the new system. The steps taken in many areas, such as justice, education, security, and innovation have also accelerated the access of citizens to state, nation, and service. <p> Mr. President, in the years when we were run by the parliamentary system, especially in the process of multi-party elections, our country has been subjected to system impositions and chaotic situations. The government's crises following the elections and the early election process caused by this situation have been destabilised, the state's order has been corrupted. The government's crises have caused gaps of governance, the world's view of different political parties closed to reconciliation, and many such excuses have led to the threat of national will by military juntas and the destruction of coups. <p> When we look at democratic management models around the world, there are three management models as presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary systems. These management models are essentially separated from the relationship between the structure of legislation and the structure of governance. One of the most important problems of the parliamentary system in our country has been the duality of governance. After the 367 crisis in the 2007 presidential election, a constitutional amendment was made for the President to be elected by the public, and for the first time in 2014, the nation elected the President directly. The situation that deepens the bilateral problem in the administration has become the most important problem to address when July 15th is threatened by a treacherous coup attempt. By eradicating bilateralism in the administration, the fundamentals of the great Turkish goal, which is quick to make and implement, thus boosting its productivity for prosperous tomorrows, ridding it of the problems inside, starting to have a say in the region and in the world. Law, judgment and execution are separated from clear lines, and our Parliament has been strengthened as a balance and control mechanism. <p> On a regional and global scale, we have internationally legal, legitimate and national policies, our backs, our security, our sovereignty rights, our historical heritage. Relationships with the Turkish world expand co-operation in many areas. The Organization of Turkish States, where all Turkish states are united, has recently been established and has begun its activities. The growing Turkish hostility in the West and also the emergence of Islamophobia stemming from the growing fear of Turkey. The Western world has always seen Turks as the flagmaster of Islam in its more than a thousand years of non-Islamic warfare. For Westerners for at least a thousand years, Turkish means Muslim, Turkish means Turkish. <p> Turkey, which was not allowed to assume a mission beyond the status of the satellite state in the context of relations with the EU and the United States and was tried to stay in orbit through NATO, sought to be drugged by moderate Islam in its new world order. Meanwhile, a social vaccine was attempted through inter-religious dialogue fiction, allowing the vaccine to become an operational organisation used for mass injection. The West carried out its final move in Turkey to govern, change the administration, take over the state on July 15, 2016, in an attempt on military coup, but in the face of the initiative, it found the unshakable will of the Turkish nation. <p> Turkey has torn up its new order shirt, which has been tried to harvest its ancestors' spirit, as well as returning to the independent, sovereign, role model state function in the founding years of the republic with the President's government system to rise in its region and the world. On this occasion, the narrow satellite that Ataturk was stuffed in after his death broke the government shell. Given this perspective, it will be easier to claim that the Republican Alliance was based on the national support, that it came from the heart of this nation, and that the alliance was formed by the great Turkish nation, not political parties. The reinforced parliamentary system will not be able to divert the caravan from its path. The achievements set out with the presidential government system in the coming period must be crowned with a new constitution that is completely in harmony with the Turkish-type presidential system, free of guardianship ethics and couptarian mentalitys. <p> During the time we left behind, the activities of terrorist organizations controlled by global forces inside and outside have been recognized, and have been put in charge of planning the terror corridor that is being created on our borders. Kurdistan's dreamers, tie-in separatist terrorists have not escaped Turkish justice, traitors such as Osman Kavala, who serve the secret services of global forces and are enemies of the state, answer to Turkish justice; those who dream of meeting with tied terrorists at breakfast will be disappointed. <p> The success achieved in the defence industry has disturbed Turkey's enemies, and the national industrial and development moves have activated these forces. Our drones, our developing weapons systems, have brought our government to the end of its dependency on the outside. The idea of Turkey, which produced its own tank, its helicopter, has caused global barons to lose sleep. In the Mediterranean, our rights were not violated, and despite us, they were shown to the whole world that nothing was done here. While Turkey is carrying out these breakthroughs, the focus to prevent this rise has begun to intercept us in an asymmetric economic war, revealing a new plan. The world's economic and social order has changed in the pandemic process, which has been under the influence of global trade and production for nearly three years. Our state has taken measures against every part of our nation in the economic war, and has not withheld its support from the state's industrialists until it works, from the employer to the tradesman's. Our government is seriously encouraging industrial investments, and the necessary steps are taken without getting caught in bureaucratic barriers. <p> My own constituency, Gaziantep, has become the engine of our country in industry and exports. In 1969, the Gaziantep Organised Industrial Region of Gaziantep, the largest organised industrial zone in Turkey, was signed by the Ministry of Industry, with its foundations laid out over 43 million square metres, and the Gaziantep Organised Industrial District-Industrial Area-Infrastrial Waterwork Protocol was signed by the Ministry of Industry. It is a necessity for our growing exports and the economy of our province to be relocated by Turkish Airlines to Erbil, Iraq, where our Gaziantep producers are engaged in heavy trade. This will reduce time and costs spent on transfer flights. Gaziantep, one of the number-one gastronomy cities in the world beside its industry, is a hot spot for local and foreign tourists. The terminal building of our city's new airport will be opened on the anniversary of Gaziantep's release from enemy occupation, on December 25th, with the participation of our President. Since there is an airport in our region that employs about 4 million people with increasing populations and internal volumes, Turkish Airlines in particular put additional flights into our major cities, such as Ankara, Istanbul, Antalya, and increasing the number of expeditions are a legitimate demand for our city. The road to Nurdaku-Gaziantep, which causes serious accidents and loss of life, must be finished at once, ahead of those losses. For decades, the watering projects of the plains of Barak must be accelerated, fertile, and accrued to these lowland water resources that are accrued to agriculture and contribute to our country's economy. <p> In Gaziantep, there is a significant production of olives as well as the production of the Felipe nut. The work to increase the production and the recollet, organised by the Chamber of Commerce, is admirable. However, the lack of a stock market for this product, the lack of a business for a packaging facility, puts the olive producer in a difficult position. It is our local producer's right to have the organization and facilities for our Antep nuts encouraged for the olive producers, and therefore to offer the manufacturer opportunities, to build an olive and olive stock in our Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture's co-operation. I hereby submit this request to the nation's bench, announcing that I will be a follower of the matter, and I salute the great nation of our budget, our country, our nation, our state.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute you all. <p> On January 19, 2007, we lost Hrant Dink. I remember him once again, with respect, gratitude, and mercy, on this anniversary that we lost after a vicious, vile assassination. <p> Again, today, in my constituency, in Ankara Beypazarı, we buried a very young police officer, we sent him to eternity, Mahmut Bilgin. I pray to him for mercy from my Lord, and to his relatives, and to his family. May the Lord keep these deaths from both Turkey and all Middle East, all Islamic geography, all humanity. As the poet says, every death is an early death. We have a desire for geography without premature deaths, and that's all we're fighting for. <p> Especially Hrant Dink, who died really early. He had a very good saying, and he said in a speech in Europe: \"Who is our doctor? Armenians are doctors of Turks, Turks are doctors of Armenians. Other than that, there's no doctor, no physician. He said that, Hrant Dink. It was really different. The general acceptance of rhetoric, the rhetoric of the status quo, is far beyond the language of status quo in terms of both the Armenian diaspora and the state of Turkey, teaching us nativeism, teaching us nationalism, teaching us how to make an Anatolian human. Mertti was a writer who kept his word. It was a real loss on behalf of Turkey. <p> There's a song called Yellow Bride, you all know. The yellow bride's song is so interesting that both Azerbaijans have interests. They say it's our song. They say it's the Turkish folk's song. They say it's the Erzurum's song. They say it's the Armenians' interest. The fact that there's so much discussion on a song isn't really a separator, it's a uniting factor. According to the Turkish man's lyrics, the song is a song that tells us how close the people of this land are to each other, how much the fate of the people of this land is in common. <p> Since the formation of the Republic, a difficult process has begun in this country for many ethnic groups, for many faith groups, for many sects. In fact, after a while of the formation of the republic, especially during the one-party <PARTY> period -- there's talk of dictatorships and such -- this country has actually seen, felt, lived, and our nation's deep memory has a very clear answer to who is the dictator in this country. In those 1940s, there were intense pressures against many ethnic groups, not only the closing of mosques, banning meetings, but the reading of persecution in Turkish, but also many ethnic groups, many sects, and great atrocities were done. Those who were harmed were not only Muslims, they were not only religiouss; those who were persecuted were also Armenians; those who were harmed were also Kurds; and that understanding was a relief in Turkey by the arrival of Adnan Menderes, and the arrival of Turgut Özal was a relief in Turkey, but with the impacts, the status quo sat down every time until the year 2000. <p> Look, you can criticize our president, our founding president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- which was expressed here too -- but in 2001, he founded the AK PARTI, starting with the AK PARTI programme, and he signed on for the duration of the Prime Minister's office as well as as as as the term of the execution of the presidency. One of the most important of these revolutions -- he has expressed himself as new Turkey -- is that on April 23, 1920, he constantly expressed the spirit of Parliament, the spirit of nation and nationality, and stood behind it and carried out silent revolutions about it, perhaps that's his most important act. Ret has stated that he has ended denial and assimilation, which he has done. My class has accepted the massacre, so I apologize if I must apologize. He has apologized on behalf of the state, on behalf of the government, and has become the most courageous leader to speak of Dersim. We know exactly what you're doing with the Kurdish issue. In 2005, the Kurdish issue was my concern. Despite the pressures of his custody, despite the coup threats, despite the pressures, the assassination threats, he took significant steps on this issue until 2009, when he launched the National Union and Brotherhood Project in 2009, and since 2009, he has actually carried out revolutions in Turkey that not only Kurds but all Turkey had ever dreamed of. <p> He had only one goal -- which today has only one goal -- that 78 million can live under one roof, under one identity, as it did on 23 April 1920, and be one nation, and look to the future in the direction of common goals. Recep Tayyip Erdogan fought for it.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, on behalf of the AK PARTY Group, I have made a commitment to the landscaping work in our country. I salute the High Council. <p> One of the most important of our renewable natural resources is the forests. Forests have been one of our most destructive natural resources in the last century. Although many international processes have been launched in the world that we are on our side against deforestation, I'm afraid the world's deforestation has yet to be stopped. Still, over 5 million hectares of forest continue to disappear every year around the world. One of the most important environmental threats to our world is global warming and climate change. The antidote is to preserve the forest and increase its field with wooding. Forests serve as the most important carbon swallows against global warming and climate change. The forests hold 25 percent of the carbon in the biosphere. <p> Forests maintain and increase carbon savings in the event they are operated sustainablely and are healed by wooding. The deforestation and deforestation of the forest reduce carbon deposits. Besides, forests are the source of the production of the wood and wood-free forest products that humanity needs. In the world, 1.2 billion people still make a living out of forests. The forests form 30 percent of the earth's terrestrial field. Our country is not rich from the forest. According to the latest statistics, 27.7% of our country is covered by forests. While our government continues to take advantage of our forests at the highest value, particularly fighting climate change, it is with great determination and determination that our forests be protected, built, reformed, and replanted. With a greener Turkey ideal, our broken forests are being built and reformed with large projects, and our empty and naked areas are rapidly being treesed. Our goal is to increase our forest presence to 30 percent in the 100th year of our republic. This is the measure of a country's self-sufficientness in terms of the presence of the forest. For this, the Forestry and Waterworks Ministry has launched a major mobilization campaign. In this framework, the development and rehabilitation of the corrupt forests was prepared and implemented in five years of wooding and erosion campaigns, covering 2008-2012 for the reforestation of the naked and erosioned areas. Many ministries, public institutions and organisations and military troops supported this campaign. In addition to many such programmes, the Prime Minister himself stressed his importance and support for this issue. The last example of this is the launch of the 5 Million Fidan Planting Campaign for 5 Million College Students two weeks ago by our Prime Minister himself. In five years, 2 million 429,000 hectares have been worked and 2 billion saplings have been met with land. Besides, 110 million saplings have been distributed to municipalities for free. Thousands of miles of land and village roads, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and graveyards have been treesed, and 13,600,000 saplings have been planted here. Over the past ten years, efforts have continued to reach a greener Turkey's goal by meeting with 2 billion 800 million plant lands during the AK PARTI rulings. In the past years, average work has been done in 75,000 hectares, while in the last decade it has increased by 6.5 times to 500,000 hectares. Again, the production of saplings has increased by six times to 470 million. <p> Mr. President, valued lawmakers, according to forest inventory studies in our country, our forest existence has increased by 30,000 hectares annually. In this last year, it's grown to 90,000 hectares. <p> As a result, as the world's deforestation continues, our country has become one of the few countries in the world to increase forest existence. That's not what we're saying. This was appreciated by OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria and said that Turkey was the world leader in the fight against deforestation and erosion in 2008. We owe it all to our Prime Minister and the AK PARTI governments, the workers of our Ministry of Forest and Water, our dedicated and ruthless forestry colleagues. <p> I thank all those who have done the work, and salute the High Council.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, dear lawmakers, of course, there is a motion for the organizational structure of the Ministry of Family and Social Policy, but I would also like to make a statement as a physician to the earlier debate. <p> Mr. Secretary is rightly trying to make a statement about the weather in the country, but there is a Prime Minister who says there is no place we haven't reached, no door we haven't been to. The telephone lines reaching Eritrea are unable to reach it. If it's not for technical reasons, if it's not for weather conditions, it's worse. In the 17th largest economy, it wasn't just saying \"give birth to a child.\" So what is it? Let's just give birth to children, let's let them go. They should be protected from their rights to live, not to witness the suffering of their children's children. Besides, I can't find medicine for a cancer patient of Mr. Erdogan, who's now a former Minister, who's making a comeback again. When he said that he saw the operation to squeeze money into his pocket, he saw this country and these eyes. In that respect, if the Minister informs the other former ministers, we'll all be happy for the health of our country. <p> I'd like to say something to the Minister of Family and Social Policy. I don't know what changes in the structure of the Ministry change in life, but it's about touching a person's life. <p> Look, I'd like to tell you a few news articles that concern themselves today in the written press in Turkey -- even when you scan so roughly. <p> Yes, the tragic death of Van Gürpınar district Yalıca village Çeli merra. <p> According to the 2012 statistics, 245,080 children met the police station this year. <p> In other news concerning the Ministry of Family and Social Policy, there are serious accusations regarding the Fethiye Women's Shelter. There's an accusation, there's a claim, but we don't know if it's true. <p> There's a story in the newspapers about severe poverty that says: \"Every child is born in Turkey with a debt of $15,600. \" Do you know what the government was in 2002 when the National Movement Party, which you didn't like so much? It was $5,525, and today it's born with $15,631, kids. I suppose you think you can't fix it with your social policies, that you can't get the kids to be born more, that when the number goes up, the stock goes down. <p> I'd like to give you another number from today's press: Savings. In 2002, we ranked 17 and 5 percent in Turkey and 101, and at that time of the government that you didn't like, we ranked 131 percent in 2013. After all, if you at least fight poverty, then mothers in this country don't really cry, fathers in this country don't really cry. Otherwise, don't let the mothers cry, don't let the fathers cry... but the children are dying. How can we not cry? If you're not crying against such a reality, it's your conscience. <p> You still haven't responded to the staff demands of employees involved in the Social Aid and Solidarity Foundation. In addition, as of 2011, the Prime Minister has a very serious statement about 4/CH. You can take it in the organization structure of the Ministry of Family and Social Policy, you can put it here, you can change names, you can change headlines, but your main roadmates want to hear from you and Mr. Secretary, the foundation staff that you work with to improve and improve the country's social policy, to find solutions. <p> Besides, it's the sociologists we want to reach 700 as a party... Okay, you said 500, there's nothing to call 500, but there's something very important. Since those who entered the KPSS in 2011 will lose their test rights again as of June 2014, the sociologists would be pleased if you gave them a calendar for the start of the 500 staff. I also think that if you put in the 4/C welfare foundation as soon as possible, they'll first get their assurances on their lives and contribute better to your social policy work. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, my dear congressman friends, I've actually said quite a lot about this matter of members of the RTÜK, so normally there's a complaint here that the law is very clear, the negotiations at the High Council meetings are confidential, and the negotiations are not announced unless the decision is made, and the decision is made by the Supreme Council as a result of the evaluation of the resension or the application to be carried out. Now, with this conviction and a complaint like that, what can the Agency do here? Resen transferred the matter to the commission instead of decommissioning it, etcetera. This commission isn't a commission for investigation, it's a review just to have information. There's a committee of officers here, courtesy of the board members, in case it's not appropriate for them to review the board members. And that's not a commission to decide. So Nurullah Ozturk is not going to decide this alone, he's just going to study it. <p> Like I said before, we don't have a problem taking down members of the <PARTY> quota. However, no one here is free of the law. Being elected from a party's quota does not free people from the law, nor does it require them to act politically. Those rules apply to everyone, everyone has to follow them. We say this in good faith. Otherwise, no one's looking at the <PARTY> quota. There is absolutely no such effort to discredit these friends. I wouldn't let that happen. <p> That's what Mr. Dibek asked. This medicine was asked, so when you applied to Parliament, what did you do as RTÜK? I mean, it's not about doing it, it's about having information, it's about having an idea. <p> It's what Mr. Tanal said. I'm in charge of the Department of Press and Information here. The Department of Press and Information doesn't have that kind of job, so it's like being in accredited. <p> It's about the yellow press card, and there's a commission. There's only one or two members of the public here on this commission. The others are journalistic communities. I mean, there's no government intervention there. It's a commission that operates more autonomously. So if there's a complaint here, if there's a disturbance, we don't make this arrangement, and administrative procedures are open to the law. <p> The other issue, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, I said it before, when it came to the agenda, I strongly condemned it. This is unacceptable, and it must be punished. I have an explanation. RTÜK also punished him for this. This program has been punished three times. Beyond that, it is now a matter which must be brought to court, and it has been brought to court. I don't know what else to do. <p> Of course, there are questions that have nothing to do with our institutions, and some of them we answer in writing because they require technical information. <p> The other thing is, it's called this negotiation and so on and so on. We've been paying attention to terminology in this process, dear friends. Instead of something in the form of a negotiation, it's a case of negotiations. Here we call it the process of peace, not the process of solutions, we call it the accelerant, and terminology, the process, is a fundamental factor. We're sensitive about that. <p> In our meeting with the <PARTY> delegation -- our friends here -- which was released to the press here last week -- the process has been general assessment. We didn't evaluate the Imranic draft or discuss issues such as amnesty, autonomy, and we didn't discuss them. Here, this process continues with social acceptance, social trust, social support and consent. And we don't have to take a step in spite of society, but I'm saying we're in the middle of a good effort to resolve a situation that has cost tens of thousands of lives. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Thank you, Mr. President. <p> Dear MPs, I have made a pledge on behalf of the National Party for Action on Article 3 of the Maarif Foundation Act. I salute the General Assembly. <p> Dear MPs, today is Azerbaijan's National Liberation Day. With the opinion of one nation, two states, I congratulate and salute the National Liberation Day of our brother country Azerbaijan. May our unity be forever. <p> Also, today is the anniversary of the death of the great Turkish writer Peyami Safa. I remember our author with mercy, gratitude, and longing, and I would like to start with the words of this great Turkish writer: \"We have to be nationalists to be Turkish, not nationals!\" <p> Dear lawmakers, Article 3 of the bill we are discussing has been defined by the bodies, bodies, and tasks of the Maarif Foundation. It is stated that the Maarif Foundation, which was planned to be established in order to help raise young people who respect high moral and national values in its country, to provide financial and spiritual support for our nation or relatives outside the country or abroad, and to provide housing and education and education, will be made up of 12 people, including the President and the Council of Ministers of Ministers and the Minister of Foreign and Finance and Higher Education of the Council of the United Kingdom of Finland. In this case, I think the trustee committee of the foundation would be dependent on the presidency and the Council of Ministers, and therefore would be biased. As the National Movement Party, we believe that since this foundation will represent our country in the international arena, the Trustee Committee should be made up of people who are experts and equipped in its own fields, not from the government. Therefore, the appointment of 12 people who will be appointed as trustees must be reviewed again and carefully. <p> It is also said that the Court of Control shall oversee the activities and accounts of the Maarif Foundation on behalf of the Board of trustees. However, financial control has not been specified by whom. There is also a need for clarity in this regard, and the relevant joke of the matter must be made clear. <p> Although a long-term study of this bill is necessary, the effort to be passed in such a short period of time creates reservations at the point of confidence in this law. As it is known, the recent impact of the foundations on the education system and the sexual abuses of homes belonging to the foundations have shown the importance of those assigned to the foundations, and our nation is concerned about them. <p> In addition, it is unacceptable for members of the Trustee Committee to serve until the age of 72 in the context of the law. Thus, he who is appointed to the Trustee will serve for about forty years. Given the way these people were appointed, they also appear to be trying to maintain the continuity of the biased administration, which makes sense. The National Education Foundation, established in each department of education and educational institutions of the National Education, is about the same as the Maarif Foundation, which aims to contribute materially and spiritually to the quality and cultural needs of society and people to meet economic, social and cultural needs. Why is a new foundation needed when the National Education Foundation is still in operation? It appears to be a question mark on all of our minds. <p> A million Turkish liras will be paid for the establishment of the Maarif Foundation by the Ministry of National Education. So we can all see that the Ministry of National Education has contributed greatly to the foundation of the foundation. In this way, the national education ministry's funding for national education will be transferred to this foundation. The fact that such a great responsibility is being rushed through the House, the fact that it is being given the proposed law, makes our nation and us greatly uneasy at the point of trust. The foundation, which is intended to be established with a fund from the National Ministry of Education budget, is set up as Istanbul. In Ankara, the National Ministry of Education requires that the foundation's headquarters be located in Istanbul, which is also a matter of need of explanation. <p> Dear lawmakers, education is the transfer of the society's values to new generations of knowledge and skill; for this purpose, teaching and training activities in schools and similar institutions. However, in 14 years in the <PARTY>'s government, 6 Minister of Education has changed, while with each coming Minister of National Education, the education system has also changed. It is said that the education system will change again, along with the National Minister of Education, which changed last month. Instead of the 4+4+4 education system, which has recently been implemented, 3+3+3+4 is claimed to be the future of the educational system. Let me make this request clear to you from the demands we have received, so that the ruling party can explain it, please. <p> Education is a serious business that concerns the future of our children. Frequently making significant and sudden changes undermines and even destroys the trust of our nation's educational system. Our children, who are our future with the changing education system, are devastated. Our parents are complaining about it. I want to continue with a story, a story about methods and methods. The method we use to do something is so important... that there are two forestmen, my friends. The first of these woodsmen cut down trees for a month, and the second one cut down trees for a month. First, he worked tirelessly to win the race and thought, \"I cut down the best trees, I cut down the most, without rest, or drinking day or night.\" The other woodsman worked the same way, and at the end of a month, the delegation was assembled and counted. In your minds, perhaps the question will arise: Which one was the 1st? Is he very hard-working, very fast, always on duty, or does he come back later and cut down trees at this point? Yes, the second was the 1st. And there's only one reason... that the first one was very angry, and he said, \"Is it okay?\" I've always worked, never rested. I didn't eat, I didn't drink, I cut down trees. And how did the second one win? The second one came back comfortably. He said: \"When you were always working, cutting down trees, while I was resting in between, I sharpened my axe. I mean, the method is very important. <p> For 14 years, the Ministry of National Education has been in control of the ruling party. Six ministers have changed and six ministers have come with new systems. These systems... so it's important not to work hard, not to stay on too many missions, but to do your job with the right methods. As it turns out, to do a job, not to do it, you have to do it in the right way, in the right way, in order to achieve the goal. Let's adapt this to the Ministry of National Education, to this office. What's the point of the Ministry? It is to carry out all the activities that will lead to the growth of young people with national, moral, and moral values. So, what's the method the ministry needs to use? Based on the right method of education, the right employment in schools, the implementation of the correct curriculum and the use of correct educational materials. However, we understand that the Ministry of National Education cannot fully control the schools within its own body. The problem is reflected in both our children and our families. <p> Dear lawmakers, we also have parents who have been victims of the education system that has changed six times in the last 14 years. So I raised two sons, and now my daughter is in college, and my son is in high school. We've all gone through different applications of these testing systems, we've all had to send our children to classrooms, we've all had to hire tutors, we've even had to give our children to private schools because we're not happy with national education schools. So, if we had had an educational system that operates with the Turkish education curriculum, if we were satisfied with this education system, would we have prepared our children for additional classes, supplementary courses? We weren't going to. So the point of attention in the educational system is that in order for children not to experience trauma, the education system, which reflects their lasting, national, moral, and moral values, must be implemented. <p> Finally, especially the interests of our beloved nation must be protected, which reminds us that we are here, and I would like to rephrase the national education curriculum. <p> Thank you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I've made a commitment to my group on the budget of 2021, the budget of the SEC and the university. I salute the High Council. <p> Our universities are institutions that perform basic functions, such as research, interrogation, qualified human resources, raising solutions to social problems. In 18 years, our number of colleges increased, our number of college students increased, and although we were relatively few, our number of faculty increased, but in Turkey, the education system collapsed, many of our universities stopped being universities. They're underfunded. Collect the budget of 129 public universities and CENTURY, not all budgets are the budget of a university that mentions its name in the world. Colleges have budget issues, physical infrastructure problems, building problems, administrative and academic freedom issues. <p> The presidents were running for office, they were running for office at the university. You've also eliminated the presidential election in the advanced democratic order. The only president in charge is the president of your party. You had to be a professor for at least three years to become a president, and then a day later, you appointed a person who didn't have three years to be a professor. Look at the rectors you've appointed: I'm our president's representative in the province. The other says it's necessary to obey the president, and the opposition means escape from the war, and it's forbidden. We're wondering if you're looking for too many of these high-profile rectors for the science world. The political and advocacyal staffing you run in colleges has taken universities out of colleges and bankrupted the academy. <p> Isn't it an ad for a private rector and an academic ad for a personal delivery to an address? Unfortunately, colleges have become experts at this. They became ordinaries professors of writing a delivery ads to the address, not about publication. The chancellor, who dived into the local seed center, published a special staff ad for his wife. Three daughters, son-in-law, nephew of a rector, serve in that university. An ad has been published for the local government program, the required condition: to be a music education graduate; it's a joke. <p> In the Court's audit report 2019, most of the ads for a university were asked to refer to a specific and specific person; only one person could apply for the entire 195 staff, and the same individuals were recruited. You were going to run the government like a company; you run it, but it's like a family business. In the Ottoman Empire, there was a time when there was a system of cradlel ulusity, which led to collapse, and now you build it in universities. At dozens of colleges, there are delivery staffs, relatives, faculty members. <p> The budget we can put into universities is already behind many universities around the world, and if those budgets are so inefficient, science will not develop, scientific work won't be done, the academy will fail. It's the knowledge that makes college a university; no merit, no knowledge. In all Turkey, as in all institutions, you have destroyed the university. With these rectors, are you going to enter the first 500? With the purchases of members of this individual's personal address? We're going to do RD, we're going to step forward with science. It's even more serious than what happened, that this system is cognitive and sustaining. On the one hand, there are teachers who commit suicide because they're not appointed, there are Ph.D.s trying to get by selling pumpkin seeds on the street, there are garbage collectors; on the other hand, there's court order, there's tulip age. You sit in palaces and you ride expensive airplanes and cars to represent the state while people are called \"squeezers.\" The sign of prosperity and civilization is not the palace you live in, but the expensive cars you ride, not the planes you fly, but the ability to provide qualified education for the children of the people who don't have a phone, tablet, computer, television, and Internet quota. <p> If the children of this country, which you have ruled for 18 years, see their future abroad; if they are condemned to unemployment, despair, unhappiness, it is a bill of mistakes you have made from education to health, state administration to economy, justice to finance in all areas. <p> According to the Court reports, we need 138 thousand teachers, who have no appointment of 500,000, while tulips are in the palace, families are in the universities. At least make the appointment of 60,000 teachers this year. Stop separating teachers from teachers by contracting them. Fulfill your 3600 promises to the teachers. Appoint 920 paid teachers who successfully and rightly pass the interview, making their choices. <p> The election is coming, the numbered days will come and go. The election comes quickly on the day of the year. People will pay you in the chest for what you've done. <p> I salute the High Council.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I've reviewed some amendments to the TBITAK Act in Article 6 of the bag law. I'm a scientist myself, retired from college, gave up nearly 30 years in college. <p> Now, there are two basics to change: <p> One of these: you know, TÜBITAK gives various financial supports to support research and development, and a number of patent rights are being created. Now, he wants to turn some of these patent rights advantages into business. That's the spirit of fundamental change in the law. <p> On the other hand, he wants to allow a number of companies to be formed in this direction. So TÜBITAK will form or form companies to provide financial income for products or inventions that are directly patented. <p> Now, we scientists have a side, dear friends, we deal in science, but we don't trade. Science and commerce are two separate things. It wouldn't be right if you tried to put these two together. I mean, you know, there's a saying in Kayseri, and there's no work in the boy, and there's no merchant, so we said, \"Let him be a professor.\" So these two are separate jobs. If you try to confuse these two, science will cease to be science, and commerce will attempt to become science, and it will fail. There's something wrong with the spirit here. <p> Besides, there's been another mistake in editing it. It's sketchy, it can be partnered, it says, but it's not specified: what will be the form of the partnership, how long will it be, what rules will it be? They were never expressed, they were released, they could do as they pleased. At one point, he'll get permission from the minister. <p> Now, see, that's one of the things we don't understand: TUBITAK is a scientific institution and will fund, support, fund research development in our country. True, beautiful, but there is a lack of TUBITAK: TÜBITAK used to be a prime minister's institution, and it was not connected, it was an institution of interest. Then, this organization, the establishment of this government, was connected to the Ministry of Industry along with a new organization on the eve of the last government's establishment, where it became the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology, where it became a relevant institution, but it didn't change: TİBİTAK was not an autonomous institution, and that's the key. <p> THE Prime Minister appoints the head of TÜBITAK, and the Science Council of TÜBİTAK (TÜBİTAK) is a member-rini, and the Prime Minister, originally and practically, again. So TUBA recommends, TOBB recommends -- TUBA again, the Prime Minister determines TUBA, and so do the others -- recommends the SEC, recommends twice as many numbers, and the Prime Minister throws out what he thinks is appropriate. Thus, a TÜBITAK appointed by the prime minister will do what the minister sees fit. This is obviously the slaughter of science in Turkey. Science is politicalized, it's something that shouldn't happen, and it has to be fixed. <p> Now, there's another thing that caught my attention. This government was very proud of TÜBİTAK (TÜBİTAK), saying that we have increased the resources of the RAGE (RGE). When they went to international institutions, they were presenting in London, in New York, in New York. Since 2007, RD spending has dropped the budget of TÜBITAK (TBITAK). At fixed prices, I looked at it, and I was surprised that it fell down at a certain number of prices. So if the government were to reintegrate the resources of TÜBİTAK (TÜBİTAK) instead of becoming a company, it would have done something even more right. I looked, there's a rise in employees, but when we look at the distribution of universities, we're really low on resources. Unfortunately, there has been no satisfactory increase in application for international refunds, payment-less, patent support for over 3,000 liras in recent years. <p> Now, I'd like to wish that the concerned minister would be here and say, \"We're never going to be corporate, we're not going commercial. Trade is the business of the private sector, and public business is simply to support science, research. We'll never mix these two together. There's a mistake here, and we're going to fix it. If he could, unfortunately, he's not among us. <p> My respects to all of you.\n",

            "Text: Mr. President, I have made a pledge on behalf of myself on October 30, 1961 for the 58th anniversary of the Workforce Agreement signed with Germany. On this occasion, I salute our Veteran Assembly and you valued MPs. <p> Congressmans, immigration is actually the fate of mankind, the origin of the story of us humans, except that it is the fate of mankind. We are a community of immigrants who believe that we will come from the wombs of our mothers to the earth, to the earth, and finally to the end. <p> Members of lawmakers, the growing inequality of the world's economic system and the increasing opening of income shears between countries, the longing for a life with better opportunities in comparison encourages people to emigrate. Master Necip Fazil Shortfurek highlighted this injustice in the following way: \"Let God wait for ten stamps of ten men/ one person, nine people, one stamp per person, and this taxi does not make a wolf of a lamb. Long live the black market guarantor of my shroud! <p> According to the report of the United Nations Refugee Organization, 272 million people in the world today are immigrants, and 65 million of them are children. Turkey, described as the world's conscience, is leading the world at its humanitarian point, and is the host of the most refugees. Our civilization has never stopped reaching out to people who need it. Today, Turkey is successfully conducting an important process on all oppressed nations, especially Syrian displaced, who have fled death. I believe that the anti-terrorism operations will be wiped out of the region's terror organizations and the Syrians who are a guest in our country will return safely to their homeland. <p> Members of lawmakers, in the past 30 October 1961, the agreement between Turkey and Federal Germany has reached 3.5 million people in Germany and some 6.5 million in the world, and our citizens are already living in their 4th generation. Of course, it wasn't an easy process. In the 2000s, the interest in Turkey's diaspora has been integrated as part of its vision of active foreign policy, along with the stability and development of domestic politics in Turkey, and has experienced the richest period in the history of institutionalisation. As of 2002, the physical resources of our citizens' consulates have been improved, and many new constructions, particularly the president of Turkish abroad and related communities, have been kept in constant contact with Turkish abroad. Again, as a result of the work of our government, Turkish citizens living abroad have been able to vote in 2014 for the first time in their country. <p> Members of lawmakers, we care very much that our work for particularly young members of our diaspora, half of its population, is about 30 years old, and that they know their culture and origins through a bilingual education. Not a day goes by that we don't have an attack on a window in Europe, or a citizen is insulted for his immigration or Muslim identity. This racism, as shown in European research and reports itself, shows itself in different ways, from street attacks to discrimination in hiring. We know that the motherland of our Turkish society abroad has felt that its belonging and trust in Turkey have been above all political views and interests for years. It is known that we have put a new study into place: the Turkish National Assembly of Foreign Affairs has been established by the Subcommittee of Foreign Affairs to help address the problems of citizens living abroad. Good luck with that. <p> The Subcommittee of the Foreign Turks and Relatives Subcommittee, which our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced during his visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina last year, will be a key concern for the immediate completion of the needs of our citizens abroad and for the move of their earlier problems to the agenda of Parliament. <p> I know that the members of the Commission have no doubt that working for the Turkish diaspora is working for Turkey, and especially for the education, health, awareness and belonging of our young peoples living in the diaspora, the contribution we can offer will mean protecting the future of our entire nation. On this occasion, I salute the General Assembly, that the work of the Subcommittee Subcommittee of the Foreign Turks and Relatives shall be fulfilled.\n",

            "Text: Thank you, Mr. President. <p> I salute all our people. <p> Today, unemployment is spreading in <PARTY> Turkey, inflation is rising, taxes are rising, people are getting poor day by day. That's why our economy is flying from the palaces of the glass. There's no point in saying it. Again, the relatively existing democracy in <PARTY> Turkey has been ended, justice has been exhausted, freedoms have been stolen, but there is no judgment on the pride of those who look at themselves from the giant mirror. Thus, we face a party that has completed its political life. That's why the <PARTY> is forcing the country to the State of Emergency for its political influence and support because there's an understanding that is trying to collapse into tomorrows of young people, women, people. <p> If not, Jacobin would have tried to address the height of the tax, to address the basic problems. Instead, the <PARTY> creates its own Robin Hood. Robin Hood gave what he had taken from the rich to the poor, but the <PARTY> gives Robin Hood's position to subsidized conglomerates, with high taxation, with guaranteed tenders. In fact, 88 per cent of the <PARTY>'s income turned into propaganda has been stolen from our pockets. It's called falling into people's pockets. <p> Political power has also collapsed into the peace, democracy, law of the country. But all these things were like bread, like water, essential. I mean, we've actually seen it very well, with the impact dynamic and the people getting poorer. <p> Unless you listen to the Kurds, the Kurdish people, unless the Kurdish problem is resolved, both the government and the government will be in a constant position to skid. Therefore, isolation must be terminated immediately, the path to dialogue and negotiations must be opened. <p> Again, the approach to the Kurdish problem is not with war policies... but with the spirit of 1921 here, sitting in this Parliament again and developing solutions to how to solve the Kurdish problem through peaceful and democratic means, I'm sure the proposals will be better off than today, Turkey and this problem will be overcome. Otherwise, nothing can be achieved by constantly attacking the Kurdish right to do politics by turning the country into an open prison. Be assured that there is no way to deceive any Kurdish people by singing only Kurdish songs in Diyarbakır. <p> Again, my friends, the trustees who were appointed with no legal basis have also fallen into Van. Local governments, which led to the public's direct participation, were nullified, and Van was handed over to almost three or five bureaucrats. Today there is a serious sense of looting and looting in Van. These three or five bureaucrats and again trustees have made every effort to keep this looting and looting order, and that's why there's been uninterrupted bans on activity and activity in Van for the past five years, because they don't want anyone poking their wheels in. <p> I'd like to tell you about a parkomat app only about this collapse story. He had a parkomat program, which had previously been launched in several streets, and he had an app. And they looked at it, and they'd come up with money from a lot of places, and they'd spread it around almost all the streets of Van Nah now, so it was literally a robbery scheme that was created over it. Instead of creating alternative roads that we know of, instead of producing parking spaces -- instead of building areas where those vehicles would be parked -- on the contrary -- the Van population has become a means of money to <PARTY> trustees, who are struggling with this unemployment, struggling with poverty, just parking in one place, so they're expanding it every day. Again, Hakeza, although this parkomat application normally returns from the Erzurum District Administration Court, there is no examination of it, despite its reflection in the Court's reports, and even the Van people see it so much that even this parkomat company is brought to Van. <p> Thank you, Mr. President. <p> Fortunately, after a citizen's application, the Erzurum District Administration Court found these parking tickets against the law. Maybe that way, this parkomat decision will be a precedent, but we already know that we don't think the trustee will abide by the law too much because he's illegal. Anyway, this parkomat app didn't solve the Vans' traffic problem in any way. Like I said, it's only a parking ticket when you park any vans on the road. Because if your trustee had already had a problem with traffic, there'd already been a multi-story parking lot in our municipalities, but because of the love of <PARTY>'s AVM, it's been converted to AVM, and now it's being thrown out as AVM. <p> Again, the biggest problem with Van is the problem with the freeway. This, though promised by the <PARTY> each year, is never finished. <p> We say: \"We will stick that stick in that wheel in any way, and all the trustees who are present in our municipalities today will be sent like that. <p> I salute the General Assembly.\n",

On this occasion, I salute all of you with love. <p> Sir, on my way out here, I brought in three items: one of them was a boron, a hammock, a half-cut pipe, a processed pipe. Of course, there's more than 30 times that. I'd like to say a few words to you about what the Bor Institute did, but about the boron mine. <p> In the last ten years, there's been a mine that's been spoken more than gold in 15 years, there's an element called boron. Bor is such an element, a mine that began to be used in Sumerian times, mummified in Egypt, used in Arabia, used in Germany, such an element. By God's will, this element is the largest in the world in Turkey. Look, I've got a report, I've got it. The element found in Turkey is 811,000 tonnes -- without adding the other -- in Turkey -- 72% of those present in the tacit world are in Turkey. Remember, didn't the father say what oil was important in the Bush invasion of Iraq? He used a phrase like that. <p> Now, this boron mine comes after us in Russia and in America, and it's 8 to 9 percent. This boron mine is used at 400 points in 400 compounds in the world. This boron mine in the world ends in 40 years, depending on the designated reserves. Who's got the boron mine? Turkey stays there. Turkey will say very different things here in 40 years. Let me give you another number on this boron mine: Turkey's export today -- 15 days later, the year ends -- is $4 billion, 700 million. This is a clause that I claim will bring more revenue to Turkey than this total mining export -- just the sum of boron, processed or half processed -- alone. Why are you saying this? Why am I saying this? Let me give you an example.\n",

Even if you tender it financially, if you tender it with the redevance system, the government gets it, but there are two systems in these tenders: one, you subtract from the price, the bidder makes an increase in price, so if it's 2 billion, it's 3 billion, 4 billion, 5 billion... <p> And then there's the rejection system. What's the Redevans system? It's a certain ratio of the monetary value of the mine. So, the state might say: I open the tender with 10 percent of the monetary value of the mine that comes out. The firm says: I give 10 percent, I give 15 percent. That's what Redevans means; that's what's right. Why? You invest $100 million in it, and you say, \"There's a $500 million mine here. You're willing to pay a price for $500 million. But now, what happens when $30 billion comes up, when you're bidding on the redevance system, and it starts at 10 percent? So instead of getting $500 million somewhere, you're going to make $3 billion for the government on the other side, which protects the investor. Why? And the investor isn't actually taking any chances. Investor, if the mine doesn't drop at the desired rate, it pays as little as the mine that comes out, if it's high, it pays a high price, that's what we're saying. In addition, when the redevance system comes out, the Mujavir will give 2/1,000 to the municipality of the province, which he does not otherwise, but he will contribute to the municipality when he comes out with redevance, and the province will also benefit. <p> Mr. Metin, Mr. Zülfü, I know you both have good intentions in this matter. We all know that Elazig has the richest beds in Turkey in mining. <p> Sir, just one more minute... We need to wrap this up. <p> But wait a minute, please, please. <p> Now, the ferrochrom has been privatized in Elazıg, hasn't it? So, is there any source in Elazıg's budget for ferrocrosis? Zero, right? But here, if this is built with a redevance system, there'll be a two-in-a-thousand deposit to the Elazig County Special Administration and Mining City. Because of its privatisation, the Mining Copper Company didn't pay the Elazig Mining Municipality 7 million dollars due to its privatisation, and is currently suing the Mine Copper Company, so I'm saying it's the benefit of the state and the benefit of the public, not the monetary value that I'm talking about. <p> I pay my respects.\n",
